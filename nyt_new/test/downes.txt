The news last Friday of the death of the ramen noodle guy surprised those of us who had never suspected that there was  such an individual. It was easy to assume that instant noodle soup was a team invention, one of those depersonalized corporate miracles, like the Honda Civic, the Sony Walkman and Hello Kitty, that sprang from that ingenious consumer-product collective known as postwar Japan.But no. Momofuku Ando, who died in Ikeda, near Osaka, at 96, was looking for cheap, decent food for the working class when he invented ramen noodles all by himself in 1958. His product -- fried, dried and sold in little plastic-wrapped bricks or foam cups -- turned the company he founded, Nissin Foods, into a global giant. According to the company's Web site, instant ramen satisfies more than 100 million people a day. Aggregate servings of the company's signature brand, Cup Noodles, reached 25 billion worldwide in 2006.There are other versions of fast noodles. There is spaghetti in a can. It is sweetish and gloppy and a first cousin of dog food. Macaroni and cheese in a box is a convenience product requiring several inconvenient steps. You have to boil the macaroni, stir it to prevent sticking and determine through some previously obtained expertise when it is ''done.'' You must separate water from noodles using a specialized tool, a colander, and to complete the dish -- such an insult -- you have to measure and add the fatty deliciousness yourself, in the form of butter and milk that Kraft assumes you already have on hand. All that effort, plus the cleanup, is hardly worth it.Ramen noodles, by contrast, are a dish of effortless purity. Like the egg, or tea, they attain a state of grace through a marriage with nothing but hot water. After three minutes in a yellow bath, the noodles soften. The pebbly peas and carrot chips turn practically lifelike. A near-weightless assemblage of plastic and foam is transformed into something any college student will recognize as food, for as little as 20 cents a serving.There are some imperfections. The fragile cellophane around the ramen brick tends to open in a rush, spilling broken noodle bits around. The silver seasoning packet does not always tear open evenly, and bits of sodium essence can be trapped in the foil hollows, leaving you always to wonder whether the broth, rich and salty as it is, is as rich and salty as it could have been. The aggressively kinked noodles form an aesthetically pleasing nest in cup or bowl, but when slurped, their sharp bends spray droplets of broth that settle uncomfortably about the lips and leave dots on your computer screen.But those are minor quibbles. Ramen noodles have earned Mr. Ando an eternal place in the pantheon of human progress. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. Give him ramen noodles, and you don't have to teach him anything.LAWRENCE DOWNESAPPRECIATIONSIf a barreling teenager knocks over a wooden fence in Deer Park, and nobody is there to capture it for YouTube, is he still an idiot?Well, yeah, say the homeowners whose property and late-night peace of mind have been violated by ''fence plowing.'' It's the latest jackass fad to swirl through the cul-de-sacs of Deer Park, Babylon, Huntington and other expressway communities on Long Island. Young men are running headlong into fences for kicks that are greatly amplified when the cellphone video is posted on the Web. The police, parents, lawyers and authors of child-rearing books are on high alert.Except for the video wrinkle, fence-plowing looks like just another eruption in a long history of teenage senselessness.Is it as certifiably incomprehensible as it appears?Maybe not, if you look more closely at the likely teenager in question. He is a pale guy this time of year, either gangly or dumpy, a jittery assemblage of adolescent muscle fibers and brain cells that will all someday assemble into an adult, but haven't yet. Sophomoric by definition, this youth is plugged into his id but not his conscience, and the stabilizing fluid of common sense is still slipping and sliding through his system like unset Jell-O.He ambles through his life, from Froot Loops to algebra to gym to homework, instructed at every point to keep his head down and to fit in. His rapidly growing brain might soon sizzle with promise, but for now it is unenchanted by school and unchallenged by its wintry habitat of houses and lawns and big-box stores. It lacks the accumulated clutter of experience that furnishes a calm and focused inner life.It hungers for stimulation, which it usually finds in a succession of flickering images -- from televisions, computers, video games, movies, cellphone screens, the scenes passing dully by his car window. For him a weekend night, no different from the ones before and the ones to come, centers on an endless stream of movies whose heroes do even stupider things than he does.Looking out from this low plateau, his horizons look cramped. He seeks to widen them somehow, by doing something else, something tactile, nonanesthetic, something to get adrenaline moving in his numbed veins.Then one night, out riding with his friends, he sees it: a fence. A plain wooden fence. It just sits there, an affront to his simmering agitation.He puts his head down and runs. He may hear the satisfying skreeek of posts and slats giving way, then feel the ecstasy of free fall and a ratifying eruption of giggles. Or he may feel the concrete-reinforced thud and ringing in the skull that tell him he has chosen poorly.Either way, he is out of breath. He is young and alive and in the company of friends. Is his behavior antisocial? Yes. It is also destructive, heedless of property rights, thoughtless, even criminal.But impossible to understand? Live as these boys live, see what they see, negotiate life with the inadequate little tool kits they have assembled, and we still might want to call them idiots. Or we might not be so quick to dismiss our sons that way.LAWRENCE DOWNESThe Suburban LifeEverybody said that the nation's anti-immigrant fever was going to spread to Texas this year.State lawmakers entered the new legislative session with dozens of bills whose anti-immigrant passions ranged from warm to extra hot. They wanted to tax money transfers to Latin America and to sue the federal government for money spent on border enforcement. One even fired a broadside at the 14th Amendment, seeking to deny the benefits of citizenship to Texas-born children of illegal immigrants. Their goal seemed to be to make immigrants' lives as miserable as possible, and to howl at Washington for not fixing the mess.Meanwhile, an energetic cohort of grass-roots advocates and legislators, Latino and otherwise, stood ready to challenge the hard-liners at every step. A bonfire loomed.But last week something strange and encouraging happened. The Legislature took a big step back from the immigration fight, as an unusual alliance rose up in support of humane, sensible reform.The powerful Republican chairman of the State Affairs Committee, David Swinford, declared that most of the immigration bills were constitutionally flawed, needlessly divisive and a waste of time, so he was not going to let them come to the floor. Some members were left spluttering -- ''Everything we do here is divisive,'' said Representative Leo Berman, author of the birthright citizenship challenge and other harsh bills. But that was all he could do.Mr. Berman, an affable Republican from East Texas, says that Mexico is the world's most corrupt country and that its citizens are infecting us with their law-breaking culture and with tuberculosis and leprosy. He has many friends in the Capitol, which is nobody's idea of an immigrant-amnesty zone.But the convictions gripping him have been eclipsed by something deeper in the Texas soul.That would be business.Mr. Swinford said he had consulted the state attorney general and concluded that most of the immigration bills would not survive court scrutiny. Never mind that some sponsors were well aware of their bills' technical flaws and were itching to attract lawsuits anyway. Mr. Swinford clearly had no appetite for crusading or grandstanding, and decisively put a lid on things.''We've got business to do,'' he told me. ''We can't be fighting and get our business done.''He was talking about efficiency. But his words could have been taken from the mouths of the powerful Texas Republicans who have entered the debate squarely on the side of comprehensive reform -- that blend of border toughness and pro-immigrant fairness that Republicans elsewhere deride as ''amnesty.''The story dates to last year. It has to do, as Megan Headley wrote in The Texas Observer, with pro-business Republicans realizing that anti-immigrant fervor ''threatened to purge Texas of the workers that pluck chickens, build houses, and make some people very rich.''Their attention was grabbed last April, when a Democratic representative, Rafael Anchia, tacked a provocative amendment onto a bill raising business taxes to finance property-tax relief. It would have forbidden employers to cut their taxes by deducting wages of illegal workers.Mr. Anchia wanted to send the message that any crackdown on illegal immigrants would be met, blow for blow, with bills going after their employers.That got Mr. Anchia a visit from Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, one of the state's most powerful lobby groups. An alliance was born.Mr. Hammond is now standing beside the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Council of La Raza and the Equal Justice Center as a member of Texas Residents United for a Stronger Texas, or Trust.The group recently sent the Legislature and governor a 15-point statement of principles on immigration reform. It urges economic development in Texas and in Latin America. It argues for cultural diversity, bilingual education and in-state tuition for illegal immigrant children. And it denounces enforcement bills of the sort piled up by the dozen in Austin.Mr. Swinford represents an agricultural district with a lot to lose from attacks on immigrant labor. (It's home to a Swift meat plant recently raided by federal agents.) But he insists he did not stifle any bills at the behest of big business.Maybe not, but he has certainly made it happy. The same week that Mr. Swinford announced that the problematic bills in his committee would die there, like the hoof-and-mouth cattle slaughtered in ''Hud,'' Mr. Hammond stood with Mr. Anchia on the Capitol steps to unveil an ad campaign urging Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.The ads were created by another new alliance, Texas Employers for Immigration Reform, which includes the Texas Association of Business and executives like Bo Pilgrim, the Pilgrim's Pride chicken magnate. Its Web site, www.txeir.org, makes some of the staunchest arguments for comprehensive immigration reform you'll ever hear from rich Republican donors and power players.This Texas pragmatism has not taken hold elsewhere. Not in Washington, where Republicans are laying out hard-core positions against ''amnesty.'' Not in states like Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, which are steaming ahead with harsh agendas.But here, at least for now, powerful forces have come to understand -- whether through warm feelings for workers or, more likely, cold self-interest -- that in attacking immigrants, Texas is attacking itself.Editorial ObserverReporters have been shuttling across the Pacific lately in search of the early chapters of Senator Barack Obama's life story. Their guidebook is his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' in which he describes his adolescence in Honolulu -- where he was born and lived through high school, except for a few years in Indonesia -- as a difficult time marked by drug use, disaffection and a painful search for identity.The New York Times listed the ingredients of his young psyche as ''racial confusion,'' ''feelings of alienation'' and ''disquietude.'' The Los Angeles Times suggested that it was not just angst, but boiling angst.Sounds oddly bleak, doesn't it? Angst boils up in most people at some point in life, but if there were any place the son of a Kansan and a Kenyan could have fit in, wouldn't it have been Hawaii? If there is a heaven, it probably looks a lot like Oahu, and the happy souls in it probably go around talking like our national spokesman for racial relaxation, Senator Obama.So who was this brooding Barry, taking lessons in African-American swagger from a black high-school buddy, Ray, studying black nationalism and going to black parties on Army bases?His struggle may seem strange in that setting, but the setting itself was strange. Hawaii, where I also grew up in the 1970's, is famously mellow about race and ethnicity. It's what you would expect from an ocean crossroads populated by Polynesians and early-20th-century plantation immigrants from across the globe. But tolerant is not the same as oblivious. Hawaii is acutely conscious of -- you could say hung up on -- racial, ethnic and cultural differences.People in this motley state, less a melting pot than a tossed salad, invented a host of slang terms for themselves. A pidgin English field guide would list buk-buks, pakes, buddaheads, katonks, mokes, titas, popolos, yobos, blalahs, haoles and portagees. These labels can be affectionate or angry, though they are usually used neutrally or with just mild rudeness, often in the kinds of ethnic jokes that passed out of polite favor on the mainland long ago.Hawaii's fixation on social taxonomy is also seen in the local habit of linking identity to diploma. The first question locals ask one another is where they went to high school. Implicit in the answer are a lot of assumptions about ethnicity and class, whether the school is Punahou (elite white and Asian), Iolani (elite Japanese), Farrington (working-class Filipino and Samoan) or whatever.There is, in this crowded paradise, a slot for everybody.Or almost everybody.For Mr. Obama, fitting in at Punahou could have been hard, given its reputation as a cliquish school dominated since missionary days by the rich white people who founded it. Mr. Obama, a scholarship student, wasn't rich and didn't look white.Beyond that, his parents -- University of Hawaii graduate students -- and his Kansas grandparents, who helped raise him after his father returned to Africa, had no roots in the local culture. He lived in a state that, then as now, had a minuscule African-American population. He seems to have been surrounded by people who knew just enough about black America to be stupidly insensitive, and his family couldn't help him.''I was engaged in a fitful interior struggle,'' he wrote. ''I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America, and beyond the given of my appearance, no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.''In one sense, he wasn't alone. Being black isn't common in Hawaii, but being biracial is. There's a Hawaiian word for it -- hapa, or half -- that traditionally refers to combinations of white with Hawaiian or Asian, though many use it for any racial blend. Being hapa is hardly cause for discrimination in mixed-up Hawaii, but it can be problematic. Dwelling on it can tie a person in knots. It can be disorienting to feel forced to choose between identities when you are both and neither. It can be infuriating to be stared at by people trying to puzzle out what you are.Vexations like these, felt by growing numbers of multiracial Americans, have helped to spur a blossoming of hapa awareness on the mainland. People are trying out the idea of a hapa culture that is greater than the sum of its parts. There are hapa conferences, hapa college clubs and hapa Web sites. More and more people consider the pursuit of hapaness to be the answer to the paradox of bifurcation. Certainly, it is powerful evidence of the irrepressible yearning for identity. So is Mr. Obama's story, his restless searching for a solace that Hawaii could not offer.I asked him recently about that search. He described a long process of pulling together the parts of his life before finding a skin he could live in. The multitudes that he contains -- Kenya, Kansas, Hawaii, Indonesia, Harvard, Illinois -- could have been arranged in infinite ways. But he settled in long ago as an African-American in Chicago, a professor turned politician in one of the most segregated cities in America.The first thing he asked me was what high school I had gone to.Editorial ObserverThere comes a moment in a Marx Brothers movie when everything comes to a dead stop so the young lovers can sing. Some are nebbishes, like Kenny Baker in ''At the Circus,'' while others are just creepy, like Tony Martin in ''The Big Store,'' but they are all painful to watch. I don't know how audiences in the 1930's, unable to fast-forward, handled the interludes. Maybe they picked up their knitting, or waited things out in the lobby.But there is an exception. Kitty Carlisle (not yet Hart) in ''A Night at the Opera,'' is neither simpering nor soporific. She is Rosa Castaldi, a gifted soprano gutsy enough to tell Italy's greatest tenor, Rodolfo Lassparri, to take a hike so she can go to dinner with her chorus-member boyfriend, Ricardo Baroni. Baroni, played by Allan Jones, could have been just another sickly stiff, but he, too, upends very low expectations by bopping Lassparri on the jaw. He also downs several pounds of spaghetti and leads a boatload of Italian peasants in one of the Marx Brothers' signature ethnic-stereotype production numbers. Miss Carlisle has her own big song, ''Alone,'' which she sings to Ricardo at dockside. It's weepy, but even it has a pleasing bite: she sings knowing that she is irritating the oily Lassparri, who has just blown off his fans' pleas for a song by faking laryngitis. You go, Rosa!Kitty Carlisle Hart, who died on Tuesday, had a life of great wit, splendor and good works. Her movie career wasn't much, but she was one of the best straight women the Marx Brothers ever had, which counts for a lot.''The loudest and funniest screen comedy of the winter season,'' The Times's critic said of ''A Night at the Opera'' in 1935. He was right, but he missed a few things. The world has come to recognize one particular gag, for example -- when a crowd of Marxes, manicurists, cleaning ladies, engineers, engineers' assistants and stewards bearing hard-boiled eggs packs into Groucho's shoebox stateroom -- as one of the funniest in film history. Our critic overlooked it. And while he praised ''that fine and gracious stooge,'' Margaret Dumont, he failed to single out Miss Carlisle.Here, then, to correct an old omission, a thankful toast: Raise a Chianti bottle and a salami to the lovely Rosa Castaldi, Manhattan's own Kitty Carlisle Hart, who helped make ''A Night at the Opera'' watchable, all the way through.LAWRENCE DOWNESAPPRECIATIONSNew Orleans is slumping into hurricane season. The danger is not just in the weather. Hotels in the French Quarter are hiring private security squads to soothe jittery guests; the police are considered outmanned and unreliable. Those polite young men with black polo shirts and Glocks are not busboys. The restaurants and bars are humming, though, and the beat of rhythm and blues pours into the street. It is a faint approximation of a civic pulse.Outside the tourist zone, New Orleans remains a city of indolence and ruin. On the edges of the Central Business District, fires are erupting in abandoned buildings, at least three in the last week. The smoke curling under the highway overpasses has an ugly chemical smell. The Lower Ninth Ward is still mostly empty, vast and mute. But there is hustle and energy in the baking heat, in places like the parking slabs near Home Depot and Lowe's, where Hispanic, black and a few white laborers gather every morning for work.I came here to talk to day laborers, because I had been told that this was the worst place in America to be one. The money was good after Katrina, in August 2005, and the work pace was frantic. Men were recruited for jobs that were plentiful, though seldom as good as promised. Conditions were dangerous and sickening. A glut of workers soon lowered wages for everyone. Intimidation and abuse were common, often by contractors, sometimes by cops.The dozens of men I met told similar stories. They stay because there still is work to do. They gather at 19 sites, usually in or near home-improvement stores, waiting for trucks to pick them up for drywall or painting, demolition or tile work. They work without gloves or masks or the promise of medical care. Crooked contractors withhold pay and threaten violence if the men complain. Wage rules and safety standards are not enforced.A city that cannot restore order or rebuild itself has somehow summoned the energy to harass the people who are doing much of the building and repairing. Squatters and workers living in tents in City Park were evicted last year, and the bustling day-labor market at Lee Circle has been shut down. Latino laborers are routinely being arrested. In Kenner, a suburb by the airport, where people shout ''Go back to Mexico!'' from passing pickup trucks, the police rounded up more than 30 laborers in January for congregating outside Home Depot. The men paid $240 fines and now meet across the street.The city is full of perils, but there is startling kindness, too.After 17 Latino day laborers were arrested in Gretna, a suburb, in February, they were bailed out of jail. Not by anyone they knew, but by members of the New Orleans Survivor Council, an organization of African-Americans that meets at a church in the Lower Ninth Ward.The men, who belong to a grass-roots group called the Congreso de Jornaleros, or Day Laborers' Congress, decided to act on their gratitude. They formed a volunteer crew to repair the ruined house of a council member, Ora Green, on Orleans Avenue. They meet there every afternoon from 4 to 7.On May 1, while immigrants across the country were marching, about 60 people converged on Mrs. Green's house to celebrate with food and music. Mrs. Green turns 87 on June 4. She held my hand in a firm grip as she told me how a contractor had pocketed $4,000 of her money and done nothing, except to throw up some drywall in a back room, even before the wiring went in.As Curtis Muhammad, a gray-bearded member of the Survivor Council and a veteran civil-rights organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, grilled chicken and hot dogs, members of the Congreso addressed the crowd, hailing the unity of African-American and Latino, of black and brown, of poor and poorer. When they were done, Mr. Muhammad walked gingerly to the top of the stoop. The old slaves and new slaves, from North and South, are uniting against the same master, he roared.People cheered, but some of the Latino men were loudly grumpy. They had thought there would be a march, as in Los Angeles and Chicago. An organizer called them into a circle to talk it over. A man with a guitar sang ''La Bamba.'' The smaller African-American contingent clustered a few feet away, around Mrs. Green, who sat in a plastic chair in a sliver of shade. A few reporters milled around, no doubt wondering what to make of the inconclusive show of interethnic solidarity.As the heat got worse and the empty water bottles and chicken bones piled up on the cracked concrete sidewalk, I thought how inhospitable New Orleans could be. Inhospitable, maybe, but not barren. Weeds burst through cracks, papaya trees in untended lots sag with fruit. The regrowth is spotty, incongruous, but as irrefutable as the shiny Burger Kings claiming corners in zones of washed-out desolation and the new two-by-fours in Mrs. Green's battered house.Civil society is still torn up here, but older, more primal arrangements are asserting themselves: predator and prey, friends and family, supply and demand. Evil contractors, resourceful businesses and toiling workers are finding niches. People who dream of a better future are trying, fitfully, to create one, while the government they once thought would protect and serve them slumbers on. New Orleans has been slammed into the 19th century, and it's going to be a long way back.Editorial ObserverWhen people bicker over immigration, it's often not long before the topic turns to My Family Came Here Legally. People whose roots go to Ellis Island or deeper like to say that. It fills their family trees with hard-working people who were poor but played by the rules, who got with the American program. It draws a bright line between upstanding Americans and those shadowy illegal workers hiding one big secret and who knows how many others.It's that line -- that moral chasm between Us and Them, and between an idealized history and the muddled present -- that informs the worst parts of the Senate immigration bill. It's not only the provisions that create an incredibly grudging path to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- charging them $5,000 apiece and requiring them to jump through pointless and punishing hoops that include a ''touchback'' trip home to Mexico, say, or Manila. It's also the belief that immigrants with little to offer us but their toil and sweat should be brought in only as guest laborers, with no hope of becoming citizens, and that the paths to entry for immigrants' relatives must be narrowed.Congress has taken the week off from the debate, with members going home to districts that have already been inflamed by the loud and loony right, which has decided that the bill is that filthy thing ''amnesty'' and that the nation's character would be defiled if it ever forgave illegal immigrants for coming here to do our worst jobs, or let too many more people in to put down roots. You could call that view unkind and uncharitable. You could also call it unwise, given economic realities.I would add un-American.My view has been informed by ''Americans in Waiting,'' a book by Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, about what he calls a lost story of a confident young country that opened itself to newcomers in ways that seem unthinkably generous today.For about 150 years, Professor Motomura writes, from shortly after the country's birth to the end of the Ellis Island heyday in the 1920s, when there were no numerical limits to immigration and the flow was mostly from western Europe, new immigrants could gain many of the rights of citizens by signing a document declaring their intention to naturalize. They became Americans in waiting, able to work, vote, buy land and clear homesteads.The elegant idea was that immigration was simply the beginning of an inevitable transition toward full membership in a growing country. The ancestors of so many Americans, including today's immigration hard-liners, benefited from it.It's important not to romanticize that history. The doors were more open for white Europeans than for members of other groups, like the Chinese and Japanese, who were almost entirely shut out. Many white immigrants -- the Irish, Italians, European Jews -- suffered profound discrimination once they arrived. Over time, the era of Ellis Island gave way to quotas, country and employment categories, and long waiting lists for everyone. With long waiting lists came people desperate enough to jump them.The newcomer, once a citizen's near equal, has come to be viewed as a perpetual outsider. The dominant view of immigration is no longer what Professor Motomura calls ''immigration as transition'' but immigration as ''contract'' and ''affiliation.'' Immigrants must meet ever-more-demanding terms of entry and slowly forge connections here before equality becomes an option.Professor Motomura does not argue that ''immigration as transition'' is the superior or only model, but rather that it should be restored to its place beside the other two. He would go much farther than today's politicians in giving rights to new legal immigrants -- even granting government benefits -- but on the condition that they take advantage of the chance to become citizens after five years. Those who do not would revert to a more limited status.Professor Motomura contends that the machinery of assimilation will work if we let it. Immigrants who are unduly insecure, he says, who are worried not only about jobs, health and finances but also contractual obligations that the United States could revoke at any time, naturally retreat to ethnic enclaves. Those who are confident in their welcome, he argues, are more likely to plunge headlong into American life.Professor Motomura, whose parents immigrated from Japan, is convinced that immigrants will cherish citizenship more if it is easier to get. Maybe that's crazy. But it's American, and reflects a confidence in this country that the architects of the restrictive parts of the Senate bill have lost, if they ever had it.Editorial ObserverIf life's a game, I can only hope it's not a game like the Game of Life. That's the one where you drive a plastic car along a winding path, going to work or college and picking up pink and blue pegs for children until you end up at a McMansion and get to count your money. I played it with my young daughter a couple of times and found it excruciating, probably because of how effectively it boiled life down to its plodding essence, a march to suburban retirement. It made me long for the solace of death, but that is not an option in this game.The Game of Life may be tedious but it's indestructible. It was invented in 1860 by Milton Bradley, updated 100 years later to the version baby boomers know and revised several times since. The subtext of virtue battling vice was ditched ages ago, but the basic format has always been one Mr. Bradley would recognize.But maybe not anymore. A new edition, perhaps the biggest rethinking of the game in 40 years, is coming out in August, to be sold beside the old one. Called the Game of Life Twists and Turns, it splits the route to bourgeois bliss into four paths of fulfillment: money, education, family and fun. Or, as the board has it, Earn It! Learn It! Love It! Live It!The idea is that life is not just about money. It's about money and experience -- or Life points, which you get by earning degrees, buying things, having babies or traveling. You don't slog to retirement now; you go around in circles until time is up. Even more radically, the game eliminates cash. In a brazen bit of corporate branding, Life(R) now takes Visa(R). Your children (ages 9 and up) will be playing with plastic.Last month Hasbro sent me a prototype, and I sat down to play with my 11-year-old daughter and a friend of hers, age 12. From a large array of starting careers, I chose strawberry picker. It suggested limited possibilities, but I figured that a hard-wired competitive streak would carry me through. I picked a green skateboard (you can buy a car later) and set out to Earn It!After four turns, I was $343,400 in debt.It soon became clear that this was not a big deal. This is not a game that forces you to ashamedly flip real-estate cards upside down to scrounge up cash. You decide what you need, and borrow it: $200,000, $500,000 or $1 million for a house, $20,000 for a college degree. You can't really skimp your way out of debt, because with every turn, things happen, expenses pop up and money comes your way -- or not. All you can do is roll with it.Everything depends on the Lifepod, a battery-powered device that acts as central banker, accountant, lottery, maternity ward and dice roller. It pays your salary, tracks your Life points, totes up your debts and deducts money automatically from your account if, say, another player gets married and needs a gift.Life went on and soon I had a Ph.D. and a $40,000 salary. I won a promotion, to nanny. I erased my debt and earned enough money and Life points to humiliate my competition. But ''earned'' may not be the best word, since my victory hinged on my having won the lottery three times.Later I watched the girls play with two friends, a boy age 7 and his 10-year-old sister. The girls all lined up on Learn It! and went into debt for college. The boy went the family route, though he was taken aback when he had to STOP! to get married. ''I didn't want to get married,'' he said. Then he had a baby girl. ''I don't want a girl baby. I want a boy. Can I take her to the orphanage?''Here's how it ended: The girls all had their Ph.D.'s and mountains of debt. The little boy never went to college, but was flush with lottery winnings and Life points, from all those kids. He won. His sister wistfully regretted having put her education ahead of motherhood.If she plays more, she may learn to strategize better, though it seems that the promise on the box -- A thousand ways to live your life! You choose! -- is not quite right. The new game has all the passivity of the old one, and whether you are a Ph.D. nanny or a 7-year-old daddy, you don't control where you end up.Money, points, everything  the electronic Lifepod tracks it all! That part is true. You don't have to keep track of money anymore. You don't count it, flaunt it or even know exactly how much you have. The Lifepod does it all for you, and when it adds up money and Life points to pick a winner, it uses a secret formula that changes with every game.The message is clear: Stop worrying and get on with Life. With godlike electronics, Hasbro has made the Game of Life easier and a little more interesting. And for all of us who don't check balances or reconcile statements and go to sleep each night on towering, fluffy cushions of debt, it's now a lot more lifelike.Editorial ObserverAll right, seal the border. Then what?Senator John McCain has been putting the question to the right-wing critics who have attacked the Senate's immigration bill as a damnable amnesty for illegal aliens. He is aiming mostly at Mitt Romney, his Republican presidential rival, but he could be speaking to anyone in the large, loud chorus of conservatives who are so furious about the immigration compromise they could spit.It's a perfectly reasonable question. Once we lock down the southern border, we lock ourselves in with 12 million illegal immigrants. Let's assume we don't want to deport them all, with a forced-resettlement program big enough to empty the state of Ohio. If we don't want another Trail of Tears and don't want anybody legalized, we will have to get rid of these people some other way.This is where the rigor of the right turns to mush. Mr. Romney talks as tough as anyone about securing the borders and despising amnesty. He is proud of the way he tried to heap layers of misery on illegal immigrants when he was governor of Massachusetts. He calls the legalization provisions of the Senate bill utterly unacceptable. But he has laid out no alternative.At Tuesday night's Republican debate, Mr. Romney had a perfect opportunity to respond to the charge that he has been pandering for votes while offering no solution other than doing nothing, which Mr. McCain memorably condemns as ''silent amnesty.'' Check the transcript: Mr. Romney had no rebuttal.If anyone ought to have thought this through, it would be Representative Tom Tancredo, who is running for president as an immigration zealot. He says he hates the bill so much he wants to unseat any senator who votes for it. But his tough talk on Tuesday was almost as fuzzy as Mr. Romney's. His campaign Web site devotes a scant two paragraphs to immigration policy. Take away the quotation from Theodore Roosevelt, and you have just one paragraph, with a single prescriptive sentence: ''The only realistic solution to the problem of illegal immigration is a strategy of attrition, which seeks to reduce the flow of the illegal alien population over time by cutting off the incentive for coming to and staying in America -- most importantly by eliminating the jobs magnet.''Attrition is the restrictionists' fallback plan, a wishful equation that with enough enforcement, mass deportation will happen by itself: Misery plus time equals no more illegals. Small-bore ideologues in places like Hazleton, Pa., and Suffolk County, N.Y., have bought into this approach, adding layer on layer of hostile legislation to drive people out.The price of this strategy is high -- far more government intrusion into daily lives, with exponential increases in workplace raids, detentions and deportations; continual ID checks for everyone, citizen or not; immigration police at the federal, state, county and local levels; bureaucrats and snoops keeping an eye on landlords, renters, laborers, loiterers and everyone who uses government services or gets sick. The strain on agriculture and service industries would be devastating. And all the things that everyone agrees are the perversities of the status quo -- exploited workers, depressed wages, a huge undocumented population within our borders -- would persist for an indefinite period until the last illegal immigrant goes home.The make-'em-suffer, wait-'em-out tactic is shockingly passive. It's a far cry from the comprehensive reform that Mr. McCain supports, which would move decisively to extend a web of lawfulness over the shadow population, signing people up for visas, doing background checks, extracting fines and back taxes and imposing other conditions. Poll after poll shows the American public supporting this assertive, fair-minded approach. But the amnesty-never hard-liners seem determined to drown them out.Maybe this country can make undocumented life so miserable as to extinguish all hope in an immigrant's heart. Maybe it can impose and enforce laws with such rigidity as to make America a beacon of hopelessness. But as an immigration policy, it's hard not to see that as delusional. As an expression of American ideals, it's repulsive.Editorial ObserverPeople who want to reform immigration by putting America in lockdown have not been shy about using fear and revulsion to get their point across. Illegal immigrants, they say, are invading the country to reconquer it, to erode our Anglo-Saxon culture and to make us all sick.Here's Representative Tom Tancredo, complaining in the Republican presidential debate about pressing 1 for English. (Aliens -- they're in your telephone!) And there's Lou Dobbs on CNN, helping racist tract-writers to peddle made-up statistics about immigrants and leprosy. (Did the country suddenly have 7,000 cases in three years? No, only a few hundred. But it sure sounds scarier.)I know at least one person who finds the fear-mongering particularly offensive. She is Nicole Holmes, an American citizen who is a threat to nobody. She is an immigrant, and she has had leprosy.Ms. Holmes, a cheerful 28-year-old, was born in Trinidad, grew up in Brooklyn and now lives outside Atlanta with her husband, Zakee, and two sons, Aaron, 3, and Andrew, 2. She told me her story by phone recently while her boys ran around the house, tormenting each other. (''Andrew, stop the biting, please,'' she said. ''Just share the car.'')Ms. Holmes learned she had leprosy, or Hansen's disease, when she was 18 and a student at Pace University. Her husband, then in the military, stood by her, taking her to doctor's appointments and helping her through a difficult treatment complicated by lapses in medical insurance and frequent moves.She is now fully recovered. She has no signs of the disease except for some scars on her arms where doctors took tissue samples for biopsies. She runs an Internet support group for leprosy patients and doctors, and is a board member of the International Association for Integration, Dignity and Economic Advancement, or IDEA, an organization that works to erase the stigma of leprosy, which it calls ''one of the most persistent and pervasive forms of social injustice that society has forced upon its fellow human beings.''Many people are surprised to learn that leprosy still exists. It is entrenched in parts of the third world, and people with it suffer greatly -- often in secret, because their shame is so profound. But leprosy is nothing but a bacterial infection that has been curable for more than 50 years. It is very hard to catch -- 95 percent of humans have a natural immunity. Patients are no longer infectious after one treatment, and those who are cured need not fear a relapse.While the disease has greatly abated around the world, the social side-effects -- abuse, discrimination, exile -- have not gone away. People with leprosy face obstacles that people with cancer or AIDS do not. Their disease has been feared for millennia. It is in the Bible, linked to sin and uncleanliness and imbedded in the language, as a metaphor for anything loathsome or untouchable.We think we know about leprosy, but our knowledge is incomplete and full of errors. The leprosy patients we have heard of are superhuman or anonymous. They are either Father Damien of Molokai, who died with the disease, or they are the forgotten Hawaiians he served, who lived in exile and lie by the thousands in unmarked graves.People with leprosy have learned to be especially wary of writers whose works are often warped by disgust or its sickly cousins, pity and condescension. A recent book, ''The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai,'' created a furor when its subjects accused the author, John Tayman, of stealing and distorting their biographies. They had the support of historians like Anwei Law, international coordinator of IDEA, who said the book twisted reality for melodrama, beginning with its cover, a photograph of the Amalfi coast of Italy that looks a lot more ominous than the sea cliffs of Hawaii. They begged to be removed from the book. Mr. Tayman, while defending his accuracy and sensitivity, refused.Between the possibly well-meaning Mr. Tayman and the blundering Mr. Dobbs, who invited a furor by defending grossly exaggerated leprosy statistics -- ''If we reported it, it's a fact,'' he said -- advocates like Ms. Holmes and Ms. Law have their work cut out for them.It's not surprising that people who oppose immigration reform would try to harness the powerful fear of leprosy to their cause. It's true that nations have been destroyed by waves of newcomers carrying exotic diseases -- Google ''European,'' ''measles'' and ''Indian.'' But the public threat of leprosy in the United States -- a few hundred cases a year in a country of 300 million -- is small.Most of those cases are among immigrants. But it is a grotesque extrapolation to claim that illegal immigration is causing a leprosy epidemic and to follow with the sweeping conclusion that all immigrants are diseased and dangerous. And anti-amnesty hard-liners are just compounding fear-mongering with foolishness when they seek to crack down on illegal immigrants with an enforcement blanket that would keep anyone who might be ill hidden, off the books and away from doctors.Villagers in rural Brazil, India and Africa, where leprosy and poverty are endemic and medical care is spotty, have understandable reasons to fear the disease. I'm not sure what our excuse is.Editorial Observer
