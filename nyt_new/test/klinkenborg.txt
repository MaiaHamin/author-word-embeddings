The heavy winds that blew through the Northeast a couple of weeks ago mostly missed our place. They took only the dead boughs, which now lie scattered along the edges of the pastures like porous old bones. The farmers up here will have a lot of cleaning to do along the fencelines before they bale hay next June or they will be baling kindling. In the woods across from our house, the wind snapped off the top of a sugar maple. The crown lies jagged, uneven, on the ground, not yet weighed down by gravity or moss. It exaggerates the disorder of nature, which seems so apparent in the absence of snow this time of year.Nearly every image of nature I have ever come across misses the sense of intricate confusion underfoot in the woods, the thickets of goldenrod collapsing into each other along the roadsides, the rotting tusks of fallen beeches broken against the western hillside. It almost never makes sense to talk about the purpose of nature. But now -- until the snow comes at last -- I could easily believe that the purpose of nature is to create edges, if only because every edge, no matter how small, is a new habitation. As purposes go, that could hardly be more different from my own, which is to reduce the number of edges here, so that the big pasture is bounded by four clean lines only, free of interruptions from sumac or knotweed or shattered maple limbs. Left to itself, nature is all interruption.These are the thoughts that crowd around during the shortest days of the year, when the sky is the color of flint and the sun, when it appears, seems to have lost its candlepower. Even the feeling of dormancy -- a harvest of rest -- is incomplete without snow. But disorder is as much in the mind as order. I drive across the county, brooding on confusion, and come upon a towering single oak, stripped of leaves but still symmetrical, mocking the sawmill that lies across the road. The sight of that one tree is enough to banish sorrow.Last night, sorting through photos I took in Kansas a couple of months ago, I found some digital snapshots of an ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornata) making its way across a gravel road. I had stopped the car and moved the turtle, in the direction it was pointed, to the other side of the road. Having written a book in the voice of a tortoise, I was of course all courtesy and did not peer closely. But last night I did look closely at the photos I took. And there is the turtle, gazing at me with a vivid orange eye, its pebbled forelimbs dotted with orange, its domed shell inscribed in an unknown cuneiform, as if to remind me that order is where you find it.VERLYN KLINKENBORGThe Rural LifeSooner or later the pickup will be packed and the dogs loaded. We'll roll down the driveway and around the corner and onto the highway. With any luck it will still be early in the morning. The horses will be standing over a bale of hay, and the chickens and geese and ducks will be wondering why they weren't let out of the poultry yard. The dogs, too, will have some questions, especially as the day of driving grows longer and longer and we don't seem to be getting to the vet or the dog sitter's house.By next week this time, we will be well down the road to Southern California again, angling across the country however winter lets us.I don't know how it came to seem so natural to load up and set out. My parents certainly had the habit. My dad especially has always liked the thought of being packed and ready to go -- and then going at first light. In the early '90s, Lindy and I hauled the dogs and horses west every summer, and when we got there we found ourselves among people who made a living hauling horses all across the country.For these people, five days in any one spot was a good, long time. But if you asked around, it was almost as easy to find people who had never been out of the county, born and raised practically within earshot of where they still lived.I try to imagine what it would have been like driving cross-country about the time I was born -- 1952. I find that I cannot. Once, when I was 7 or 8, I rode home from my grandparents' house in my grandparents' car -- 100 miles with my grandfather behind the wheel. His top speed was 35 miles an hour. It nearly killed me.I wanted to be anywhere but the back seat of that old Dodge plodding down the highway. Now, of course, I would love to see all over again what I must have seen on that trip, the hogs in the fields, the creek-bottom pastures, the windmills and farmhouses. Iowa was not yet a tyranny of soybeans and corn.I am struck this time by the change in how I imagine the trip across the country. It has become so easy to look down the road. The last time we made this trip -- two years ago -- I spent what seemed like weeks staring at the road atlas, pondering the mysteries of the American highway system. We set off with a clear sense of how we were going to go -- south-southeast out of the winter and then due west -- only to be pushed off course by a major ice storm in Arkansas.The weather is still the major variable. Now, instead of the road atlas, I find myself contemplating the National Weather Service Web site -- the page displaying a map, updated every five minutes, of all the weather warnings, watches, alerts and advisories across the country. Right now, the only good weather slot across the West is near El Paso.Just this morning I ran through the whole trip on the G.P.S., mile by mile, turn by turn. I plotted out some driving distances on Google Maps, wondering how long we'll want to drive each day.I scouted a couple of Web sites that list dog-friendly lodgings along the way. Between the G.P.S. and the BlackBerry, I realize that we're driving west this time in a cloud of information -- the exact opposite, I suppose, of that trip with my grandparents, when all the information worth gleaning would have come in conversation with the two old people in the front seat, born in the late 1880s after all, and with the world that lay beyond the highway ditches.Editorial ObserverIt was a fitting end to the trip -- a 15-mile traffic jam snaking over Cajon Pass and down into the refrigerated depths of Southern California, where avocados were freezing on the bough and sprinkler-soaked lawns had iced over by morning. The day before we left, it was 70 degrees at home in upstate New York.The route was snowless nearly till Santa Fe. But we drove through flurries in the Mojave Desert, and the traffic jam was caused by more snow falling on the San Bernardino side of the pass than we had seen at home in all of November and December. The jam was a place to put impatience aside, to never-mind the 2,900 miles we had come and hope that somewhere in the last 30 miles the traffic would break up.Here is what has changed since the last time we made this drive: In 2005, it felt as though the trip was continuous with all the long-distance drives my family had taken when I was a kid. Those trips embodied the modesty of our expectations. We were camping in those days, not staying in motels, and driving, not flying or taking the train.Driving across the country was not only normal, it was a sign of frugality. But this time I felt the excess in the trip. Partly it was a matter of knowing we were on the wrong side of the global carbon equation. But it was also like traveling along the edge of one's historical epoch, and knowing the judgment that would be made upon it in the unimaginable future. The scale of the road system -- the volume and velocity of its traffic -- seemed grievous. And so did the painful, nagging question of whether there is any way to make this American way of life sustainable. As easy as the drive was, it felt untenable.It still surprises me that if you get up morning after morning and drive all day you eventually get to California. And it almost still surprises me that you can get up morning after morning and drive all day. The miles came and went, the soybean fields of Illinois, where water stood in place of snowdrifts, the hills of Missouri, the broad sweep of Oklahoma shoaling off into Texas. We headed out of Tulsa an hour before any sign of dawn, and I could barely realize that that long-imagined way-point was now slipping behind us. No matter where we stopped, it seemed hard to believe that we were really there, because the only there was the pickup cab and the two sleepy dogs in the back-seat and the sound of our audiobook.''Last spring, 1846, was a busy season in the city of St. Louis.'' So the book began. It was Francis Parkman's ''The Oregon Trail,'' which recounts his adventures along the Platte and Arkansas Rivers in what are now Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado.Nothing defines the moment in which you travel like listening to the moment of someone else's travels. By coincidence, we began the book as we crossed the Mississippi into St. Louis, and whenever Parkman mentioned the trail to Santa Fe, we felt a historical serendipity, as if we had more in common with him than the fact that we were pointed west.From the distance of 160 years, it is easy to see the boundaries of Parkman's historical epoch. Every buffalo he comes across is ''stupid,'' and of the bulls he writes, ''Thousands of them might be slaughtered without causing any detriment to the species, for their numbers greatly exceed those of the cows.'' He feels a profound ambivalence toward the emigrants who are just beginning to crowd the trails west. He can praise the Indians he meets only by comparing their bodies to the works of ancient Greek sculptors.Parkman was not yet 23, and he carried a large quiver of judgments, all of them sharp-edged and many utterly wrong. Most of them he eventually set aside, becoming one of America's greatest historians. We listened to him not for his prejudices but for his powers of observation, his ability to translate the freshness of the prairie in language that still sounds newly felt. While Lindy drove, I thought about a sentence of Parkman's, something he says after an unnamed Indian looks at a vacated campsite and names the very men who stopped there. ''By what instinct he had arrived at such accurate conclusions,'' Parkman writes, ''I am utterly at a loss to divine.''The real question, of course, is by what instinct Parkman chalked up the careful observations of a very different mind to instinct. It was a way of asserting primacy, of assuming that that Indian knew what he knew without knowing how. That passage marks a seam between two cultures, a profound gulf between Parkman and his Native American compatriot. The more I thought about Parkman's words and our trip west, the more I began to feel as though we were driving along a seam of our own, across a landscape of vanished knowledge, secure in a cultural instinct that was coming, year by year, to seem more and more insecure. Then, around Victorville, we were brought to a dead halt by the snows of San Bernardino County.Editorial ObserverIt may seem odd to celebrate a prefix. After all, it isn't even a whole part of speech. It does for a word, visually, what a big cigar does for a small man. But even as prefixes go, ''post-'' is unusually adaptable. It signifies transcendence, surpassing, moving past, leaving behind, and yet it does all these things while remaining attached to the very thing the prefix is leaving in the dust.It is even capable of compounding itself. We are, of course, no longer postmodern but post-postmodern, if not in fact post-post-postmodern, which would make us not pomo, but popomo. We cling to post- in part because we have no idea what we are pre-. In these prefixes -- post- and pre- -- there is a world of wonderful confusion. Think only of the Pre-Raphaelites who were actually Victorians and thus, in fact, Post-Raphaelites.The most innovative user of the prefix post-these days is the post-Austrian governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says that he is now engaging in ''post-partisan'' politics. He has a serious point, which is that the number of independent voters in the state is growing even as the number of registered Republicans and Democrats is dropping. To many of those independent voters, the arcane machinery of party politics may look a little antiquated, especially since the current occupant of the White House seems to be post-Republican -- even post-electoral -- though, of course, never post-partisan.But calling himself post-partisan is really Mr. Schwarzenegger's way of cutting himself free from the political agenda of his nominal party. A few other politicians -- Michael Bloomberg, for instance -- might well use the word too.The beautiful irony of it all is that there is nothing remotely post-political in being post-partisan. Even the most political candidates may come to think of post-partisanship as a necessary precursor to being pre-presidential.VERLYN KLINKENBORGAPPRECIATIONSImagine a poem that is perfect in shape but refuses to say anything. And yet it sells well because it is the only kind of poem available for more than half the year, and people insist on reading poetry, even out of season. That is the winter tomato. In redness and roundness it says ''tomato,'' in every way except the one that matters: flavor.Earlier this month, the federal Agriculture Department put an exception into its rules to let a tomato called the UglyRipe be shipped out of state. Those rules say a tomato must be at least 2 9/32 inches and no more than2 25/32 inches in diameter. The UglyRipe doesn't meet those specs -- it's ribbed at the top and not uniform in shape. It is also reputed to taste very much like a tomato.Perhaps the real virtue of the UglyRipe's ''ugliness,'' which is nothing compared with the deformed beauty of true heirloom tomatoes, is that it helps us see how strange the uniformity of regular winter tomatoes really is. For a backyard grower, taste is everything. But in commercial production, taste is an abstraction. It is what's left after all the other criteria for a good commercial tomato have been met: disease resistance, regular shape, consistent ripening, the ability to withstand picking and packing and shipping, a long shelf life. Taste is too subjective, according to the Florida Tomato Committee, to judge tomatoes by.The UglyRipe may be a better tomato. After all, its growers have selected for better taste, not perfect shape. But one thing that would certainly make the UglyRipe a better tomato is a different way of growing it. Santa Sweets produces organic UglyRipes, but they are few and hard to find. It now grows its conventional tomatoes without using agricultural chemicals that carry reproductive risks -- but it still uses methyl bromide, a powerful, ozone-depleting pesticide, to fumigate the soil in which conventional UglyRipes grow.Under the terms of the Montreal Protocol, the use of methyl bromide was supposed to be phased out completely by January 2005. But for the past few years, the Bush administration has claimed an exemption for ''critical uses,'' one of which is growing winter tomatoes in Florida. We used to consider it a luxury to eat fruits and vegetables out of season. But what we eat out of season has been machined to withstand the rigors of the supply chain and produced in ways that only our ignorance can sustain. The truth is that there is no luxury -- nor critical use -- in it. Even an ugly, better-tasting winter tomato isn't worth the price.VERLYN KLINKENBORGEditorial NotebookWhere does the truth of history lie? In coups and revolutions, in wars and treaties and the chronicles of our textbook heroes and antiheroes? Or does it lie in the pulse of ordinary life, in a dailiness that looks almost hallucinatory if you venture outside it? I think of Ryszard Kapuscinski, who died at 74 on Jan. 23, as an emissary between those two versions of history. His writing life divides between the conventional reporting he did for the Polish press agency PAP -- a voluntary slavery, as he described it, that made the whole world available to him -- and the literary journalism that has found its way into books like ''Imperium,'' ''The Soccer War'' and ''The Emperor.''He was both witness and reporter, and an enduring reminder of the fact that the two are not the same.In October 2003, Mr. Kapuscinski gave a talk in Berlin called ''Herodotus and the Art of Noticing.'' The art of noticing is a fine phrase, in part because it implies the writer's presence in the midst of what he is observing. But for Mr. Kapuscinski the art of noticing also says something about language. ''How could I describe a jungle in the language of the press?'' he asked.Mr. Kapuscinski lived in a kind of journalistic exile, always traveling, always moving on to the next big story, in Africa, Latin America and the former Soviet Union. Nothing feeds the art of noticing like a sense of dislocation. And what Mr. Kapuscinski noticed was that the reality of life as it is lived overwhelms what he called ''the everyday language of information that we use in the media.''It is worth resisting the temptation to push Mr. Kapuscinski to the far literary edge of journalism, to insist on his kinship with writers he himself named -- Capote and Mailer and García Márquez. To me he belongs to the very heart of this journalistic enterprise because he was such a sound critic of it. In his work he reminds us again and again how profound our senses are -- what a foundation they are for everything we call intellect -- and how little we remember to use them.VERLYN KLINKENBORGAPPRECIATIONSThe other night there was thunder along the lower flanks of the San Gabriel mountains. It began just before dark, and at first I didn't recognize what I was hearing. I thought it was the sound of Thursday night: the rumble of heavy plastic trash dumpsters, a whole street of them, being wheeled out to the curb.The rain came and went and came again, throwing the scent of eucalyptus and dust into the twilight, the scent of this dry California winter. We watched the lightning -- quick as a lizard's tongue -- from a plastic picnic table at Juanita's, a taqueria near the San Bernardino Freeway. If you were driving past Juanita's in a hurry, you might almost mistake it for a bail-bond shop, except that bondsmen are partial to neon and don't wear hairnets at work.We are living farther down the alluvial skirts of the San Gabriels than we did when we were here two years ago. In fact, we live down in the part of town that is what tract housing looked like half a century ago -- uniform houses, stucco-clad, whose only homage to their location is small windows on the south side, where the desert sun lives. Across the street, a perfectly graceless little two-bedroom, one bath, has been marked down to $465,000.This was jackrabbit country once, and now it is full of jackrabbit houses. At 7:50 a.m., all the cars back out of all the driveways at once. You can feel the haste -- see someone dash from the house to the passenger door even as the car begins to roll backward out of the garage. I'm sure the same thing goes on in the ochre mansions higher up the mountain, where every now and then a cougar steals a Doberman from its own backyard. Everyone can feel the freeway beckoning.What I find myself looking for here in L.A. is a sense of dislocation. And what I've come to realize is how closely dislocation and a sense of the ordinary are linked. I've discovered that I'm looking for a different topography than mountain and ocean, cactus and palm, landmark and icon. I find myself watching instead for the pattern of ordinary life, which is all the more moving to me here because I do not understand its rhythms.I listen to band practice in the neighborhood park. I admire the profusion of baseball gloves in the local sporting goods store, a reminder that the amateur season is well under way here. I watch a young father in scrubs and his soccer-daughter waiting in line at the local burrito place, and I wonder what it's like to grow up taking good carne asada for granted. I try to see how people's lives are shaped, how they construct what seems normal to them, and whenever I get a glimpse of it, I find all the dislocation I could ever want. It is like standing on a strange lawn in the dark watching the glow of a television on the living room ceiling.What I'm describing is a familiar pattern in Los Angeles. We go exploring along the boulevards, up La Brea, down Pico, over on Wilshire. All the business is on the boulevards and so are all the landmarks. But what always catches my eye are the side streets, which yawn open for an instant, left and right, and then close again, like gaps between the rows in a field of corn. A glimpse is all we allow ourselves: a double row of trees shading a quiet street, houses moated by lawn and landscaping. And yet looking into the crevice of each side street is like looking into a separate decade. I wonder what I would know if I lived there, and what I would take for granted.We, in turn, have cobbled together our own private life here, so different from life in the country at home. I ride a bicycle up the alluvial grade to teach, and when office hours are over, I coast all the way back, across the MetroLink tracks and down onto the jackrabbit flats. The dogs, who are used to a pasture, stare transfixed at the squirrels on the power lines overhead, and they woof mournfully through the chain-link at a cat standing two houses away.The morning we arrived, I brushed against a glossy shrub at the edge of the driveway. A tart oily scent clung to my hands. It took me half a day to place the smell. It was rosemary -- not a sprig of it but whole, in the bush and about to bloom. It's not as if I'd forgotten the smell of rosemary, lost the memory of it somewhere on the trip west. What I'd forgotten is the difference between familiar and unfamiliar, expected and unexpected, out here where the herbs grow wild and the thunder is solid citizens taking the trash out to the curb.Editorial ObserverMention honeybees, and most people think two things: stinging and industriousness. A beekeeper thinks: jubilation, harmony, the civilization of insects. Nothing in nature is more vibrant -- literally -- than a strong hive on the increase in late spring and early summer. And few things are more depressing than opening the lid on a hive and pulling apart the supers, the boxes where bees raise young and store honey, and finding that the colony inside has died.It is far more than the death of individual bees. It is the death of prosperity itself.My dad kept bees when I was young, and now I keep them. There were problems in my dad's day: ants, skunks, wax moths and a couple of deadly but well-known bee diseases, like foulbrood and nosema. But my dad's day -- the late 1950s and early '60s -- looks, in retrospect, like a golden age. No one had heard of tracheal mites or varroa mites -- two tiny pests that have decimated hives in the past 15 years and made beekeeping much more complicated than it used to be.Now there are alarming reports of a new bee problem, called colony collapse disorder. ''Disorder'' is something of a code word. It means that no one really knows what is causing the sudden death of hives. There were heavy losses last fall, mainly affecting migratory beekeepers, who move their colonies from crop to crop as fields and orchards come into blossom. The threat of this new disorder isn't merely the loss of bees. It's also the loss of crops -- a long list of them, including most tree fruits -- that depend on pollination by honeybees.Scientists are already hard at work searching for the cause of this disorder, which may be fungal. It may even be that transporting hives from crop to crop stresses bees more than we think. But I know from my own experience with bees -- as someone who keeps only a couple of hives, never moves them and leaves most of the honey for the colony itself -- that we must do everything we can to keep these creatures among us, as much for their sake as for our own.VERLYN KLINKENBORGEditorial NotebookI am sitting on the front porch of my father's house in a small town in the heart of California's almond country. It will be 80 today, the first day of daylight saving time. I have been watching the park across the street for hours.I can hear the delayed irregular heartbeat of a basketball game on the far side, all the slap gone out of the ball at this distance. A young boy pedals his bicycle across the lawn, and I suddenly remember how reluctant a bicycle feels on grass, how hard it is to urge it forward. A girl -- just barely a teenager -- walks to the diamond to practice softball with her father. On the way, she walks a dozen feet behind him. On the way home, she walks half a block ahead. He is a terrible pitcher.The horizon across the park is a line of cement tile rooftops. Beyond them, the almond groves begin, invisible from here but discernible nonetheless. Everything would feel different if those almond groves weren't there, if the houses went on and on, as they tend to do in this state, until they terminate in a parking lot or a freeway. The houses across the park, a decade old, would be nearly identical if they weren't so intently un-uniform, gables here, a mansard roof there, and front doors in every degree of involution.This is a quiet neighborhood in a quiet town. Every now and then a car passes -- nearly always an S.U.V. roaring like a jet -- and a garage door opens automatically and the S.U.V. is ingested, after spilling the children onto the driveway: a boy with a bat, a girl with a jump-rope, a younger sister with a pink baseball glove.Toward sunset, my dad and I go for a drive west of town, into the glare of the sun, which is lying just above the tops of the evenly pruned orchards. On the way to the country, we pass through the new part of town, the rich part, where the houses are nearly new, monuments in the architecture of encrustation. They look like fortresses facing each other across the street or, taking each one on its own, like something you might find on the turquoise gravel of a starter aquarium next to a treasure chest sending up a stream of bubbles. The front yard has vanished in this neighborhood. There is instead a paved forecourt for cars and a hangar-size garage. It is as if the vehicles that occupy these driveways decided to build nice living quarters for the people who operate them.Where the houses stop, the orchards begin. The almonds are just past full blossom and beginning to drop their petals. I always drive through these orchards with a sense of wonder. The whole world has been ruled into lines of perspective. But these are not tall trees, and the almond branches converge well before they reach the horizon, which creates the illusion that the orchards are endless. I never drive past them without wanting to stop the car and walk down the long swaths of grass that lie between the trees, into an infinite checkerboard of light and shade and blossom. The trees have been planted with industrial precision, but the effect is completely aesthetic, as if these were groves in a pleasure garden.As we approach, a Cooper's hawk detaches himself on the wing from a high bough and drifts into the orchard a few feet above the ground. He stays with us, gliding through row after row of trees, eclipsing himself until he vanishes from sight. At crossroads, we come upon old farmhouses -- and sometimes a very new one -- almost hidden in the orchards, broken shade all the way up to the back porch. We pass a family playing baseball in a pasture in the extra hour of light. It is a treacherous game on that ground.And then the orchards end in piles of boughs and overturned stumps -- the trees have been toppled and the good firewood cut out and hauled away. It is hard to say whether the trees had lived out their productive lives or whether the land has been sold for houses. We pass mountains of almond hulls and a paper mill and a steel fabricating plant and a processing plant for eggs. We turn back into the old heart of town and cross over the spine of the Central Valley -- Highway 99 -- and drive back to my dad's house. I realize that I don't really know what to call his neighborhood. It isn't suburb or exurb. It is the recent edge of an old-fashioned town, but in a year or two, the edge of a brand-new development will have reached it, and what to call it then will be even harder to say. I am thinking of calling it simply urb.All day long there has been only one question on my mind. The day seems almost perfectly still, but it is a stillness against the backdrop of steady, intensifying change. What is it like to grow up, to live, amid such constant, radical alteration? What effect does it have on how you think of the future? It is, I suppose, all part of a succession. The native grassland gives way to orchards, and the orchards give way to houses, and I can't stop myself wondering what the houses will give way to.Editorial ObserverBut the grass beyond the fence parted, and a head poked up. Then more heads. The vacant lot wasn't vacant at all. It was occupied by a prosperous colony of ground squirrels -- Spermophilus beecheyi, named after the English explorer Sir Frederick William Beechey, who visited California in the H.M.S. Blossom 180 years ago. I did not know about Sir Frederick at the time. I knew only that these were ground squirrels and that this vacant lot was a ground squirrel subdivision and that I had just eaten a burger and a doughnut for lunch in the city of Pomona, Calif., which is named for a minor Roman goddess of tree fruits.What surprised me were the burrows. They were mounded at the entrance, like the burrows you'd find in a Wyoming prairie dog town, and they somehow turned the vacancy of that empty lot into habitat. The squirrels stood guard on their haunches and raced from hole to hole. Almost instinctively I found myself imagining their tragic history, composing the saga of the ground squirrel in my mind. This was a relict population -- the last of a dying breed, cut off from their kind by the unconscious savagery of human encroachment, their world now bounded by an auto parts store, a busy highway, the back alley of an apartment complex and the parking lot of Donut & Burger. The San Gabriel Mountains loomed impossibly distant for them. I wondered if they had been reduced to eating fries.But you don't have to read very much about Spermophilus beecheyi -- never mind Sir Frederick William Beechey -- to realize that California ground squirrels are nearly human in their adaptability. And like all creatures that are nearly human in their adaptability, humans consider them pests. Ground squirrels invade gardens and damage plants. They can carry bubonic plague. They destroy the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Their burrows can extend for dozens of feet.I found myself telling a new story. The ground squirrels in that vacant lot are colonists, opening new terrain to an expansionist species, developing the site before the human developers can do so. Perhaps this is one of a series of vacant lots scattered across the Los Angeles basin, an archipelago of ground squirrels quietly shaping the earth to suit their needs. They watch the humans eating at Donut & Burger and know their time will come.The squirrels reminded me of my last flight to Wyoming. I changed planes in Denver, and during the layover I watched a small flock of sparrows -- five or six -- that were living in one of the terminals. They betrayed no anxiety, no frantic fluttering toward the lights or windows. They behaved exactly the way sparrows do when they're at home. They flew up to an architectural strut and preened, and then flew down to the carpet and hopped across the waiting areas, silently scavenging for food. I imagined a separate species of sparrow evolving over the years to come, breeding quickly, adapting precisely to the conditions inside Denver International Airport.I drive past Donut & Burger from time to time on my way to the freeway. I look into the lot and try to catch sight of the squirrels looking out at the traffic. Perhaps they know what an idle concept vacancy really is. I catch the Foothill Freeway a mile or two north, and I notice, again, how common it is to see hawks soaring high overhead. Now I know what they are feeding on.Editorial ObserverWhat did Jane Austen look like and why should we care? The only undisputed portrait -- a drawing of the novelist in her nightcap -- was done by Austen's sister, Cassandra, about 1810, when Austen was 35 or so. Almost anyone who examines this naïve portrait is likelier to impugn the artist than the model. And yet a Ms. Helen Trayler, who works for an English publisher, has recently said of Austen, ''She was not much of a looker.'' That's why Ms. Trayler's company has beautified this portrait for a new book. Austen's cheeks have been rouged a little, her nightcap has been removed, and she now looks like a stern cross between the logo for Columbia Pictures and the head on a Roman coin.This is only the beginning of the Jane Austen makeover. A new film about her will come to this country in August. It is called ''Becoming Jane'' and stars Anne Hathaway, who was last seen in ''The Devil Wears Prada.'' Ms. Hathaway is indeed a becoming Jane. Publishers of ''Emma'' and ''Pride and Prejudice'' and the rest of Austen's works should simply reprint a still from the film -- Ms. Hathaway in Georgian costume, superbly blushed and coiffed and playing cricket -- and call it ''Jane Austen,'' with the quotation marks. The novels would be so much richer if only we could believe they were written by a looker.I reread ''Emma'' recently and found myself wondering, what if we knew as much about Shakespeare's life as we do about Austen's? And what if we knew as much about Austen's life as we do about Virginia Woolf's? No one would give up the chance to have 150 letters by Shakespeare or 26 years of copious diaries by Austen.But the work always stands apart from the life, no matter how much we know. No amount of biography -- no grasp of the details of the life as it was lived -- ever accounts for the transfiguration that takes place in the work itself. You can search all you want in the life, but you will never find the ghostly separateness, the act of imagination, in which the work emerges.I was only a few pages into ''Emma'' when I realized that I was reading with a smile on my face. It wasn't just renewing acquaintance with such old, old friends -- Emma Woodhouse herself; her ailing and slightly querulous father; Mr. Knightley (whose given name, I always forget, is George); and the grand female talkers in the book, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton.I was smiling at feeling the very separateness of the world the novel creates and at watching the adroitness with which the author governs the reader's awareness. The text of Austen's novels is the most persuasive biographical detail we can ever have of her. Her work is the product of her unremitting attention, and we can see the character of that attention -- that mind -- more clearly in the novels than in anything else we know about her. The same thing might be said of Woolf, about whom we know so much more, and of Shakespeare, about whom we know so much less.I had not only forgotten that he was George Knightley. I had forgotten that in a polite spasm of near-disgust, Mr. Knightley says to Mrs. Elton, ''Come on a donkey, however, if you prefer it.'' I had forgotten that Emma had introduced a ''large modern circular table'' to her father's house and how closely her patronizing chatter with her protégée, Harriet Smith, resembles the patronizing chatter of Mrs. Elton herself, for whom Austen's favorite stage direction is ''laughing affectedly.'' One of the great pleasures of a reading life is picking up an old, familiar novel thinking that rereading it will mean a kind of reminding, when, in fact, the novel makes itself new all over again. It is as if the novel holds itself apart, waiting for real life to erase enough in us to make us suitable readers once more.I never wish I knew how pretty Austen was or how she dressed or how her voice sounded. (On the other hand, I wish intently that modern publishers did not care how handsome or beautiful their authors are.) But let me put it a different way. I would like to know how anyone who lived 200 years ago talked or sounded or dressed or ate or felt.I would recover all the unrecoverable details about any life that passed in those days just to come to terms with the distance and the difference of the past -- and I do mean any life, not just those of the writers or the statesmen.It is a failing to read Shakespeare and feel impoverished by the lack of biographical detail. It is no less a failing to read Austen and wonder what the mirror said when she looked into it. I cannot think of anything that would make ''Emma'' richer than it is.Editorial ObserverLast week I read with my students an essay by Lewis Thomas called ''On Medicine and the Bomb,'' which was first published in 1981. It has been a long time since I taught it -- probably 20 years -- and a lot has changed since Thomas wrote it, including the structure of global politics and most of the numbers he uses.It is a strikingly simple essay. Thomas surveys the state of research and practice in several medical fields, including bone marrow transplants, burn therapy and the treatment of what he calls ''overwhelming trauma.'' And then he considers the good of all these resources against the prospect of a nuclear missile falling on New York City or Moscow. Which is to say no good at all.This is a useful essay for young writers. It reminds them of the importance of dwelling wholly in each sentence they make. It teaches them to trust the reader. Thomas never hints where he is going. His prose is plain. He never exaggerates. He presents facts, one by one. But reading the essay is like watching a great magician perform a simple card trick. One card, two cards, three cards. But then he lays down the last card, and it's the one you've been having nightmares about your entire life.My entire life, I should say. At the end of our discussion, I asked my students, mostly freshmen and sophomores, whether they had grown up with any fear of nuclear holocaust. The answer was no. My students are so very old that I always forget how young they are. The youngest were born in 1988. If they came to some embryonic political awareness about the same age I did -- I was 11 when Kennedy was killed -- then it happened about 1999. After we finished with Lewis Thomas, I went home in the night feeling as though I were carrying a precious relic of memory inside me.The answer my students gave -- that utterly unhesitating ''no'' -- brought back to mind a few of the landmarks in the coming of age of my own nuclear fears. They include Pat Frank's ''Alas, Babylon,'' Peter Watkins's ''War Game,'' John Hersey's ''Hiroshima,'' Stanley Kubrick's ''Dr. Strangelove,'' Jonathan Schell's ''The Fate of the Earth,'' to which one might now add Cormac McCarthy's ''The Road.''I remember -- and it seems very strange to have to ''remember'' -- the way these books and films seemed to stimulate and desolate me, the way they led me to a point from which I always had to find a way to turn back. The problem wasn't trying to imagine the unimaginable. The problem was trying to realize that it had been carefully planned, as Thomas says, by ''so many people with the outward appearance of steadiness and authority.''And yet somehow that was also the point of balance, the small consolation. It was possible to have at least a little faith that even the amount of cold, rational will it would take to start a nuclear war would almost surely prevent it from starting. This masked the fundamental insanity of it all, and it was a reminder -- in case you ever forgot it -- that the only possible recourse we could have was to elect the most rational, and the most human, leaders we could. Everyone else was simply out of the loop.In class, it occurred to me -- and to my students -- that Thomas's piece could be rewritten about global warming. You could show how little we have done, and how far we have to go, to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, survey the technology that would allow us to hold back the rising oceans or cope with increasingly violent storms or provide us with alternative sources of energy. You could argue, as Thomas does in the case of the bomb, that ''we need, in a hurry, some professionals who can tell us what has gone wrong in the minds of statesmen in this generation.''Except, of course, that climate change is not just about statesmen, not about the men with secret access codes and red telephones on their desks. It is about all of us, in every choice we make every day. I had the false but unspeakable luxury to grow up in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was possible to believe in the very otherness of the nuclear insanity that threatened the world.I look at my students and realize that they are in the first generation to grow up knowing that there is no otherness to the insanity that threatens us now. The insanity is what we call normal, and it is all our own. My students are better prepared for this than I am, because they have never been allowed to believe that the problem of climate change is merely a matter of politics at the highest level. They know it is their problem.We got this far in our seminar that night, possessed by the quiet outrage that Thomas so perfectly expresses and a little puzzled by the different burdens our generations seem to have assumed. And what I said, of course, is that for all the familiarity with which we turn to the problem of global warming and the responsibilities it thrusts upon us, the nuclear arsenal Thomas was talking about still exists. The numbers and the global politics have changed, and the capacity to handle radiation sickness and burns and trauma has grown. But too many weapons still stand, waiting.What it still comes down to, in Thomas's words, is simply this. ''Get a computer running somewhere in a cave, to estimate the likely number of the lucky dead.'' This is a fear my students will have to grow into.Editorial ObserverIf you read Kurt Vonnegut when you were young -- read all there was of him, book after book as fast as you could the way so many of us did -- you probably set him aside long ago. That's the way it goes with writers we love when we're young. It's almost as though their books absorbed some part of our DNA while we were reading them, and rereading them means revisiting a version of ourselves we may no longer remember or trust.Not that Vonnegut is mainly for the young. I'm sure there are plenty of people who think he is entirely unsuitable for readers under the age of disillusionment. But the time to read Vonnegut is just when you begin to suspect that the world is not what it appears to be. He is the indispensable footnote to everything everyone is trying to teach you, the footnote that pulls the rug out from under the established truths being so firmly avowed in the body of the text.He is not only entertaining, he is electrocuting. You read him with enormous pleasure because he makes your hair stand on end. He says not only what no one is saying, but also what -- as a mild young person -- you know it is forbidden to say. No one nourishes the skepticism of the young like Vonnegut. In his world, decency is likelier to be rooted in skepticism than it is in the ardor of faith.So you get older, and it's been 20 or 30 years since you last read ''Player Piano'' or ''Cat's Cradle'' or ''Slaughterhouse-Five.'' Vonnegut is not, now, somehow serious enough. You've entered that time of life when every hard truth has to be qualified by the sense of what you stand to lose. ''It's not that simple,'' you find yourself saying a lot, and the train of thought that unfolds in your mind as you speak those words reeks of desperation.And yet, somehow, the world seems more and more to have been written by Vonnegut and your life is now the footnote. Perhaps it is time to go back and revisit that earlier self, the one who seemed, for a while, so interwoven in the pages of those old paperbacks.VERLYN KLINKENBORGAPPRECIATIONSIn my left hand I am holding the throat of Maria Sharapova's tennis racket -- a confection of titanium and graphite strung with some durable synthetic fiber. My right hand closes loosely on the grip. This is still a surprise to me: having a racket in my hands, standing on a tennis court, waiting for the ball.I have been taking lessons for the past couple of months because tennis is so Californian, because the world will soon be nothing but asphalt, and because I have not spent enough of my life using the hand-eye reflexes that are such a pleasure to use. The physical aspects of the game are hard enough -- the footwork, the strokes. But the hardest part -- here it comes, just crossing the net, a phosphorescent green moon -- is watching the ball.In the next court is a young player, a girl who is perhaps 9 years old. Her coach is hitting balls to her. My coach is hitting balls to me. The girl next door has been playing tennis for a couple of years, it looks like, and her potential is a matter of physical gifts and good coaching, and how hard she wants to work. I have begun at 54 and am now 10 weeks into it.What could I do at 9 as well as this girl hits a tennis ball? I could read, hours a day. I try to remember this when the world seems to be full of 9-year-olds mastering everything. I wonder whether she has trouble watching the ball.Not that the ball is hard to see. It is a cautionary chartreuse. It stands out sharply against the court, the windscreen, the grassy slope, the shade of the pines and eucalyptus, the mountains that rise in the distance. The ball is soundless coming at me, though I can hear the hollow pop of balls being struck in the courts nearby. This time I am going to watch it all the way. But I try to remember to shift my weight and so, having a general sense of where the ball is, I stop watching the ball.I replay in my mind the sight of Rafael Nadal practicing on a side court at Indian Wells last month and how the ball sizzled in the air. I watched another pro, Andy Murray, bouncing the ball on the edge of his racket in an idle moment. I try to imagine what it is like to have spent most of one's life in communion with a tennis ball. I hope someday to watch the ball the way these players do. I don't mean see or understand or know the ball. I mean keep my head pointed at it, eyes focused on it, watching the ball.The ball has always eluded me. Partly it is a matter of doubting what happens if you keep your face pointed at an incoming object -- a grounder that may take a bad hop and bruise the very eye that is watching it. But partly it is a matter of thinking, falsely, that athletic grace lies somehow in the realm of the peripheral.Witnessing -- how the name comes back! -- Graig Nettles in flight at third base or Tiger Woods with a long iron, you can see only the fluid lines of motion described by arms and body and legs. What you can never see is how closely they watch the ball, the distinction they enforce between the ball and the everything else that is not the ball. Until now, I never understood that all the grace there is flows from watching the ball.When I do -- so my coach says -- my body stays down and balanced, coiled. When I do, I strike the ball cleanly, and it flies true. It reminds me of the story John McPhee tells about Arthur Ashe, about how he was taught to hit tennis balls with a broom handle as a way to narrow his gaze. This, of course, was somewhere around age 9. Better if I play with Sharapova's midsize racket and just keep trying to watch the ball.I have every incentive to keep my eyes on the ball. This entire practice session, I tell myself, I am going to think only about watching the ball, which, I soon realize, is different from watching the ball.But I am watching the ball now and here it comes and it is not a metaphor and I am actually watching it, all of my awareness on the ball, and none left over to be aware of watching it, and when I hit the ball it has some zip, and it dives into a corner of the court just in, and it is a fine thing no one is there to hit it back.Editorial ObserverI am writing from a mile high in a small Wyoming town on the edge of the Wind River range. The snow on the nearby buttes -- the gift of late April -- has finally melted, and the creek bottoms and pastures and hayground are an unhoped-for green. The drift of cotton from the cottonwoods is almost over, but the lilacs are still in high bloom. The town is nearly damp with their scent. When I come inside and can no longer smell it, I try to picture it in my mind. It is two scents really, a floral dissonance, a sweet astringency. There is a dark, grating baritone of sorts, which is veiled by a lighter, more liquid perfume -- a second soprano, I suppose. I find myself wondering how a scent so strangely unsettled can also feel so homely.We are driving across country again, heading home from Southern California. It did not occur to me until this drive how segregated the botanical scents of Southern California really are. You come upon them in pockets -- a planting of this, a gathering of that, upwellings of sage and jasmine and orange blossom and rosemary. But a half block down the street the fragrance has faded or been overlaid, or simply surrendered to the ozone. By late afternoon our first day on the road, we were a little short of Cedar City, Utah. We stopped to switch drivers, and when I stepped out of the truck the breeze was suddenly full of the fragrance of unhardened grasses. The desert was long behind us -- the Joshua trees and flowering yucca -- and so was everything that Southern California calls to mind. But it took that smell on the wind to make me know it.We had to climb higher still before we came upon the lilacs. We caught up to them in Coalville, Utah, near the southwest corner of Wyoming. They were growing in every yard along the gravel street on the edge of town, just as they do in the town I am writing from. By the time we get home the lilacs will have gone by. When we first bought our small farm in upstate New York, nearly 10 years ago, I spent part of one summer trying to grub them out. They seemed so ordinary, so deeply familiar. It says almost enough about where I was raised to say that I was raised among lilacs.Here, in the scent of them, I can smell the spareness of a cold climate, the beautiful austerity of a short growing season. In its own way, a lilac is as pushing, as immodest as anything that grows in Southern California. But when I smell lilacs, I see a nearly bare yard in a small town and children playing in the weight of their scent, not knowing what it will come to mean to them in time.VERLYN KLINKENBORGThe Rural LifeRecently, I flew from Denver to Ontario, Calif. The next-to-last leg of that flight is mostly over desert, and at night the desert floor means darkness. Then we came over the mountains, and in the distance I could see a dim line of lights slowly rising to fill the horizon, the leading edge of the luminosity that is Southern California at night. Before long we were descending, wheels down, over a district of low, flat buildings, enormous in scale, their parking lots and loading bays gleaming under mercury and sodium lamps.But what caught my eye just before we landed was another kind of light. It was the ragged edge of a wildfire off to the south, probably the Gypsum fire near Yorba Linda. It was dull orange, highly variable, often obscured by its own smoke and then flaring brightly once again. There was no geometry, no steadiness to it, and that lack of proportion and symmetry was as much a part of the fire's wildness as the fact that it had escaped from human control. Other wildfires have been burning around the region, too, in Griffith Park and on Catalina Island. These have been widely scattered burns, but they raise the fear of a different kind of fire -- the kind that begins in separate places with separate names but merges into a single conflagration and is best remembered by the year itself, the way 1988 is remembered in Yellowstone. This year may well bring that kind of fire to Southern California. It is the driest year in the last 120 years. The hills are just waiting to go up. The question is what else will go up with them.The sight of that wildfire has stuck in my mind. It took the form of a wavering, shallow V on a distant hillside, and, of course, it reminded me of other wildfires I have seen. But whatever that fire was in itself -- and it was contained by the next morning -- it also helped me visualize global warming in a more literal way than I ever have. I suddenly saw that there are fires everywhere, all around us all the time, but fires so wholly controlled that we no longer think of them as fire at all.I drove back to my college town that night along the San Bernardino Freeway. The traffic was light and lulling. But there were fires burning in the engines of every vehicle I saw. The lights in our quiet town were themselves a serene combustion, waypoints along a nearly infinite electrical grid that is itself a kind of wire-drawn fire. I got home and saw the porch light burning, its filament kindling in the darkness. The dull-orange haze of night in Los Angeles was the transposed heat of millions of domesticated fires.A picture came to mind -- the familiar sight of a gas flare at the top of the refinery stack in Laurel, Mont., a wavering flame of unwanted gas lighting up the night. I remembered a passage from the journals of John Cheever -- a paragraph from 1954 describing ''the winter fires of New York burning like the gnats in Benares,'' the incinerating of mattresses, wooden crates, cardboard cartons, uptown and down.It began to seem to me that we are a species of fire-starters, and that all of our imprisoned fires are just so many versions of yet another cook-fire on the edge of night in a land where fuel has grown scarce from all the cook-fires of all the people.I thought about this sudden vision for a couple of days. At first, it seemed almost overwhelming. I tried to picture all the combustions that are essential to the human ways of life in all their global diversity. I wondered what Earth would look like from our neighborhood in space if we could see all our incandescences, in all their forms, glowing at once. There would be only a faint corona of anthropogenic combustion, but it would be more than enough to have begun overwhelming the atmosphere, which is, after all, such a thin, faint halo around this planet.The image of the cook-fire kept coming back to mind -- the cook-fires I saw burning last June in a village in Tanzania, where every day the problem of fuel presented itself all over again. Sooner or later a wildfire burns itself out for lack of fuel. The question, I suppose, is whether our species will do the same.We will see what the summer brings in the way of wildfires in Southern California -- and, still worse, what October brings when the winds really begin to stir. The drought that afflicts the region probably has nothing to do with global warming. It may simply be part of the natural pattern of wet and dry cycles in the Southwest. If the hills do go up in smoke, they will add their carbon load to the atmosphere, and it will perhaps crystallize in our minds the effect of all our more domesticated flames. But, eventually, the wildfires will die down, and life will return to normal and that momentary vision will subside.Editorial ObserverCorrection:  May 25, 2007, Friday  In the May 23 Editorial Observer about fires in California: John Cheever's journal mentioned burning ghats, not burning gnats. Ghats are stairs from temples to the Ganges River in India, where Hindus traditionally construct funeral pyres. Gnats, of course, are tiny insects.The tires whine, and sometimes they moan. Sometimes they send up a whistle I don't even hear until it stops. Now and then the asphalt runs smooth and true. But mostly the interstate is a series of discontinuities -- a sharp thump as we hit a shallow overpass, a few miles partly paved with recycled rubber, a long sequence in western Nebraska where the tires make the sound of the special effects in Walter Mitty's mind. And then there is Omaha, where the freeway looks smooth but is really a dozen heavily corrugated miles that must drive the truckers insane.In imagination, Interstate 80 is a single line, the shortest practical distance between San Francisco and New York. To be at any one point on that line is to feel the length of the whole, as if the only here that matters is the here you come upon when you're finally there. I get so used to watching the landscape zoom past us that I lose track of the fact that we're the ones zooming along while the landscape stays perfectly still.I think of that when we come to the Nebraska grasslands. A windmill is pumping water into a stock tank surrounded by cattle. The grass is bent low. These are reminders that the wind is more than just the breeze of our passing, the bucking windstorm that follows a semi. This is a native wind, quartering down stiffly out of the northwest. This is the wind that everyone who lives here learns to live with.Whenever I drive across country, I carry a single question with me, and I ask it over and over again. Could I live here? It's natural enough, I suppose -- a central question for a species whose habitat is defined as much by imagination and emotion as it is by strict biological constraints. It's a question that raises the matter of time as much as place.Cutting across central Wyoming, I look up a draw and see a sheltered spot under the hills where the sagebrush breaks into grass, and I think, ''I could live there.'' And I could, now, because living anywhere has been made so easy in our time. It's no longer really a problem of physical limits -- how far you have to haul water and salt and flour, how long you can go without company. But what I'm really asking when I wonder ''Could I live here?'' is ''Who would I be if I did live here?'' To that question I never know the answer.Some places seem obviously unlivable to me, like Jeffrey City, a nearly abandoned town in the middle of Wyoming that sprang up during a uranium boom and died a couple of decades later. The answer is equally no along the southern fringe of Cheyenne, where a new Jeffrey City is being built thanks to the petroleum boom that has turned the state upside down.But when I find myself asking ''Could I live here?,'' I usually get a more equivocal answer, and it is the uncertainty that sets me thinking. I see an abandoned farmhouse on the high plains, a broken down corral, the ruins of a few old cottonwoods, and I can imagine hearing the notes of a meadowlark being carried away on the wind as I go to work on the place. I have to remind myself that in this simple experiment in relativity -- I am the observer traveling at 75 m.p.h. -- I cannot allow myself to imagine living anywhere I can see from my current position. But what if it were a place just like this and over the horizon, out of the sight of so much movement?Perhaps this is a mental game that everyone plays -- a way to test the life you are actually living. You drive through a small town at night and wonder what it would be like to feel at home in one of those houses where only the bedroom lamp is still shining. You wonder what your own life would look like if you could somehow stand outside it as a stranger.But what this question always confirms in me is something I must have understood when my wife and I decided to settle on a small farm in the country. Driving across America, I see place after place I can happily imagine living. And what I notice is that they are mostly uninhabited places.So Nebraska comes to an end, and the next day we drive into Iowa, where I have already lived a good part of my life. It has been raining since dawn, and now the wind is pounding down from the north. There is water standing in every row on the hillside fields, and it has begun to cut across and run down to the creeks and rivers, carrying Iowa away to the Gulf of Mexico. Two more days on the road and we will be back in the place where I no longer wonder if I could live there because this is the place it turns out I live.Editorial ObserverSeven years ago, I planted a pair of white spruces -- Picea glauca. They came by mail in slender tubes from a nursery in Oregon, mere wisps of vegetation. I wasn't sure where I wanted to put them, so I stuck them in an improvised nursery bed, beside the sweet corn and the pole beans. A year later I moved them just inside the fence along the gravel road that runs past our place. It has been to their liking. Those trees are now well over 10 feet tall -- lone emissaries from the great forest of white spruces that reaches across Canada.There is always an assumption of selflessness in planting a tree. You're supposed to think, while digging the hole, how far into the future the tree will grow and what shallow, unconvincing weeds we humans are in comparison.It's true that I'd like to see these spruces in another 80 years. But I can take in the whole tree now. I can watch the growing tip -- so wan in early June -- gradually turn into trunk. I can still remember that I planted these spruces myself. When they are fully mature, they will seem to have planted themselves.The rest of the garden grows much faster. The peas and beans shoot up and so will the tomatoes and corn. But every year the vegetables get to be just so tall, just so ripe, and then down they come with the harvest, the frost. I know their limits as well as they do. I am not going to be staggered by a patch of corn that turns out to be 30 feet tall. The garden will tell me soon enough where the summer went.But I'm staggered by these spruces nearly every day.They are growing in full view of my office window so it should not be possible for them to sneak up on me. And yet every year they do. I began asking, ''How did they get so tall?,'' when they were only waist-high. I'm still asking now that they're beginning to dwarf me. I'd like to say that slow has turned sudden in these spruces, because we imagine a stoicism in the way trees grow. But I've been a close witness of their vegetative life, and in my mind I cannot keep up with it.VERLYN KLINKENBORGThe Rural LifeLast week, the Audubon Society released a new report describing the sharp and startling population decline of some of the most familiar and common birds in America: several kinds of sparrows, the Northern bobwhite, the Eastern meadowlark, the common grackle and the common tern. The average decline of the 20 species in the Audubon Society's report is 68 percent.Forty years ago, there were an estimated 31 million bobwhites. Now there are 5.5 million. Compared to the hundred-some condors presently in the wild, 5.5 million bobwhites sounds like a lot of birds. But what matters is the 25.5 million missing and the troubles that brought them down -- and are all too likely to bring down the rest of them, too. So this is not extinction, but it is how things look before extinction happens.The word ''extinct'' somehow brings to mind the birds that seem like special cases to us, the dodo or the great auk or the passenger pigeon. Most people would never have had a chance to see dodos and great auks on their remote islands before they were decimated in the 17th and 19th centuries. What is hard to remember about passenger pigeons isn't merely their once enormous numbers. It's the enormous numbers of humans to whom their comings and goings were a common sight and who supposed, erroneously, that such unending clouds of birds were indestructible. We recognize the extraordinary distinctness of the passenger pigeon now because we know its fate, killed off largely by humans. But we have moralized it thoroughly without ever really taking it to heart.The question is whether we will see the distinctness of the field sparrow -- its number is down from 18 million 40 years ago to 5.8 million -- only when the last pair is being kept alive in a zoo somewhere. We love to finally care when the death watch is on. It makes us feel so very human.Like you, I've been reading dire reports of declining species for many years now. They have the value of causing us to pay attention to species in trouble, and the sad fact is that the only species likely to endure are the ones we humans manage to pay attention to. There was a time when it was better, if you were a nonhuman species, to be ignored by humans because we trapped, shot or otherwise exploited all of the ones that got our attention. But in the past 40 years, we have killed all those millions of birds or, let us say, unintentionally caused a dramatic population loss, simply by going about business as usual.Agriculture has intensified. So has development. Open space has been sharply reduced. We have simply pursued our livelihoods. We knew it was inimical to wolves and mountain lions. But we somehow trusted that all the innocent little birds were here to stay. What they actually need to survive, it turns out, is a landscape that is less intensely human.The Audubon Society portrait of common bird species in decline is really a report on who humans are. Let me offer a proposition about Homo sapiens. We are the only species on earth capable of an ethical awareness of other species and, thus, the only species capable of happily ignoring that awareness. So far, our economic interests have proved to be completely incompatible with all but a very few forms of life. It's not that we believe that other species don't matter. It's that, historically speaking, it hasn't been worth believing one way or another. I don't suppose that most Americans would actively kill a whippoorwill if they had the chance. Yet in the past 40 years its number has dropped by 1.6 million.In our everyday economic behavior, we seem determined to discover whether we can live alone on earth. E.O. Wilson has argued eloquently and persuasively that we cannot, that who we are depends as much on the richness and diversity of the biological life around us as it does on any inherent quality in our genes. Environmentalists of every stripe argue that we must somehow begin to correlate our economic behavior -- by which I mean every aspect of it: production, consumption, habitation -- with the welfare of other species.This is the premise of sustainability. But the very foundation of our economic interests is self-interest, and in the survival of other species we see way too little self to care.The trouble with humans is that even the smallest changes in our behavior require an epiphany. And yet compared to the fixity of other species, the narrowness of their habitats, the strictness of their diets, the precision of the niches they occupy, we are flexibility itself.We look around us, expecting the rest of the world's occupants to adapt to the changes that we have caused, when, in fact, we have the right to expect adaptation only from ourselves.EDITORIAL OBSERVER
