Nothing in ''The Jungle'' sticks with the reader quite like what went into the sausages. There was the rotting ham that could no longer be sold as ham. There were the rat droppings, rat poison and whole poisoned rats. Most chilling, there were the unnamed things ''in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.''Upton Sinclair wrote ''The Jungle'' as a labor expos√©. He hoped that the book, which was billed as ''the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' of wage slavery,'' would lead to improvements for the people to whom he dedicated it, ''the workingmen of America.'' But readers of ''The Jungle'' were less appalled by Sinclair's accounts of horrific working conditions than by what they learned about their food. ''I aimed at the public's heart,'' he famously declared, ''and by accident I hit it in the stomach.''''The Jungle,'' and the campaign that Sinclair waged after its publication, led directly to passage of a landmark federal food safety law, which took effect 100 years ago this week. Sinclair awakened a nation not just to the dangers in the food supply, but to the central role government has to play in keeping it safe. But as the poisonings of spinach eaters and Taco Bell customers recently made clear, the battle is far from over -- and in recent years, we have been moving in the wrong direction.When ''The Jungle'' was published, the public reaction was instantaneous. Outraged readers deluged President Theodore Roosevelt with letters. Roosevelt was ambivalent, but he invited Sinclair to the White House for lunch, and promised to send his labor commissioner and assistant Treasury secretary to Chicago to investigate.Sinclair settled into a New York City hotel and started a publicity campaign. He wrote articles with titles like ''Campaign Against the Wholesale Poisoners of the Nation's Food,'' and released more stomach-churning details. Armour made its potted hams, he charged, by taking nubs of smoked beef, ''moldy and full of maggots,'' and grinding them with ham trimmings. In a newspaper letter to the editor, he dared J. Ogden Armour, the meatpacking magnate, to sue for libel.Sinclair suspected Roosevelt's team would do a whitewash. But its report strongly reinforced the allegations of ''The Jungle.'' It included an array of Sinclarian images, like workers using privies without soap or toilet paper and returning ''directly from these places to plunge their unwashed hands into the meat.'' Popular outrage continued to grow, and the momentum for reform became unstoppable.As a result of Sinclair's crusade, Congress passed the Food and Drug Act, which had been effectively blocked by industry. At the start of 1907, it became a federal crime to sell adulterated food or drugs, and the new law set up a system of federal inspections. Food had to be labeled, and it was illegal to misstate the contents. Future laws would expand on this newly declared government responsibility to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply.In recent years, the momentum has shifted. Since the Reagan era, conservatives have tried to turn ''government regulation'' into an epithet. Books like ''The Death of Common Sense,'' a 1990's best-seller, have twisted the facts to argue that laws like a New York ordinance requiring restaurants to clean dishes in a way that kills salmonella are somehow an infringement on liberty.Food safety has been particularly hard-hit by this anti-regulatory climate. Harmful bacteria are rampant in meatpacking plants and in produce fields, but government oversight is eroding. The Bush administration has slashed the number of Food and Drug Administration inspectors, and it has installed a former lobbyist for the cattle industry as the Agriculture Department's chief of staff.But this is an unusually promising moment for food safety. Wide media attention was given to last fall's spinach contamination, which killed three and injured more than 200 in 26 states, and to the Taco Bell food poisonings, which made dozens of people ill. And Democrats have recaptured Congress, which should hold hearings to get to the bottom of those recent food disasters and to explore what the next ones are likely to be. It should push for larger budgets for food inspections and, as one Democratic-sponsored bill calls for, create a single federal agency with responsibility for food safety.The powerful meat and produce industries can be counted on to call on their allies in Congress and the White House for help in resisting. That would come as no surprise to Sinclair, who was already complaining loudly in 1906 that Armour & Co. had contributed $50,000 to the Republican Party, and that the meatpackers had hired a prominent government official ''as confidential adviser as to federal inspection problems.''The answer, Sinclair believed, was always the same: providing the American people with the gritty truth that they needed to protect themselves. ''The source and fountain-head of genuine reform in this matter,'' Sinclair insisted, ''is an enlightened public opinion.''Editorial ObserverJack Cline is in a hospital here fighting for his life, stricken by leukemia that he says he got from exposure to benzene at his factory job. In most states, he would be able to sue the companies that made the benzene. But Alabama's all-Republican, wildly pro-business Supreme Court threw out his case.In a ruling that would have done Kafka proud, the court held that there was never a valid time for Mr. Cline to sue. If he had sued when he was exposed to the benzene, it would have been too early. Alabama law requires people exposed to dangerous chemicals to wait until a ''manifest'' injury develops. But when his leukemia developed years later, it was too late. Alabama's statute of limitations requires that suits be brought within two years of exposure.Mr. Cline, who says God has kept him alive so he can challenge the unfairness of Alabama's law, told his lawyer, Robert Palmer, to keep fighting. Mr. Palmer started a statewide petition drive, wrote a flurry of op-ed pieces and asked the court to reconsider. In an extraordinary move, it reopened the case and heard new arguments last spring.Big business and its allies are loudly promoting ''tort reform'' by arguing that America is drowning in frivolous lawsuits. They are winning the public relations battle. Everyone knows the story of the woman who sued McDonald's because she was burned by hot coffee. But few people know of the Jack Clines -- and there are many of them -- who have been denied their day in court.Corporate America -- with its large contributions to political and judicial candidates, and its top-dollar lobbyists -- has had remarkable success persuading legislatures and courts to erode the bedrock principle of civil law: when people are injured, they are entitled to sue for damages.At the top of industry's list of tactics is immunity -- the rather brazen notion that companies should be shielded from lawsuits no matter how negligently or dishonestly they act. Gun makers and dealers, notoriously, persuaded Congress in 2005 to give them immunity when their guns are used to maim and kill.Industries are also winning immunity at the state level, and attracting far less attention. Pharmaceutical companies pushed through a law in Michigan protecting them when their drugs injure or kill people, as long as the drugs were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. There is no reason F.D.A. approval, a deeply flawed process, should be a shield.When corporations do end up in court, they have lowered the stakes substantially by undermining punitive damages, which have long been one of the main ways that society deters people from unreasonably putting others at risk. The United States Supreme Court struck a major blow against punitive damages a decade ago, ruling that it was unconstitutional for a jury to award $2 million in punitive damages against an auto dealer that knowingly sold a damaged, repainted BMW as new.Lower federal court judges, many of whom have been screened by the Bush administration for pro-business sympathies, and state court judges, many of whose campaigns were bankrolled by big business, are eagerly joining in. So are state legislatures. Last month Ohio's legislature voted to cap punitive damages in many cases against paint companies -- which have been accused of selling lead-based paint that causes retardation in children -- at a paltry $5,000.Perhaps the most insidious tactic for slamming the courthouse door on injured people is the stealth use of ''pre-emption.'' When federal and state laws conflict, the federal law pre-empts, or invalidates, the state law. The Bush administration is taking advantage of this principle by issuing weak regulations in a wide range of areas to wipe out stronger state-law protections. When people try to sue, they may find that their legal rights have been swept away. Among the areas the administration has focused on are automobile roof crushes and mattress flammability.These incursions on the right to sue, taken together, are a serious assault on justice. In the most extreme cases, they may also be unconstitutional. Mr. Cline's lawyer, Mr. Palmer, argued that preventing him from ever suing denied him his rights under the Alabama Constitution to seek a legal remedy for his injuries.Mr. Palmer was encouraged when the Alabama Supreme Court reopened the case. He also saw it as a good sign when it scheduled oral arguments for a special public session on a law school campus, an indication it considered the case particularly significant. The arguments went well. ''Questions asked by several justices indicated they were troubled by the legal Catch-22,'' The Birmingham News reported.The court ruled this month. It affirmed the dismissal of Mr. Cline's case by a 5-to-4 vote. If Mr. Cline wanted to challenge the unfairness of the rules, it said, he would have to take it up with the State Legislature -- a body every bit as pro-business as the Alabama Supreme Court.Mr. Palmer intends to take the case to the United States Supreme Court. In the meantime, Mr. Cline can take some small comfort in the close vote. Four Alabama justices, at least, would not accept a legal system that told people like him that ''no matter when'' they ''file the action, it is either too soon or too late.''Editorial ObserverPresident Bush doesn't seem to care that Congress wants a bigger role in guiding the Iraq war. Talking about his plan to send in 20,000 additional troops, he said on ''60 Minutes'' that he knows Congress can vote against it, ''but I've made my decision and we're going forward.''It is hardly the first time this president has insisted that he is ''the decider,'' or even the first time he's used the Constitution to justify it, as Vice President Dick Cheney did when he told Fox News: ''The Constitution is very clear that the president is, in fact, under Article 2, the commander in chief.''But Mr. Cheney told only half the story. Congress has war powers, too, and with 70 percent of Americans now opposed to President Bush's handling of the war, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll, it is becoming more assertive about them. Congress is poised to pass a resolution denouncing the troop increase. Down the line, Congress may well consider mandatory caps on the number of troops in Iraq, or setting a date for withdrawal.If it does, we may be headed toward a constitutional clash, with the administration trying to read powers into the Constitution -- as it has with its ''enemy combatant'' doctrine and presidential ''signing statements'' -- that the Founders did not put there. The Constitution's drafters were intent on balancing power so no one branch could drift toward despotism. The system of checks and balances that runs through the document divides the war power between the president and Congress.The Constitution's provision that the president is the commander in chief clearly puts him at the top of the military chain of command. Congress would be overstepping if, for example, it passed a law requiring generals in the field to report directly to the speaker of the House.But the Constitution also gives Congress an array of war powers, including the power to ''declare war,'' ''raise and support armies'' and ''make rules concerning captures on land and water.'' By ''declare war,'' the Constitution's framers did not mean merely firing off a starting gun. In the 18th century, war declarations were often limited in scope -- European powers might fight a naval battle in the Americas, for example, but not battle on their own continent. In giving Congress the power to declare war, the Constitution gives it authority to make decisions about a war's scope and duration.The Founders, including James Madison, who is often called ''the father of the Constitution,'' fully expected Congress to use these powers to rein in the commander in chief. ''The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it,'' Madison cautioned. ''It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legislature.''In the early days of the republic, the Supreme Court made clear that Congress could limit the president's war powers -- notably in the Flying Fish case. In 1799, during the ''Quasi War,'' the undeclared sea war between the United States and France, Congress authorized President John Adams to clamp down on trade between the two nations by stopping ships headed to French ports. But Adams went further, ordering commanders to stop ships that were sailing to or from a French port.When the Flying Fish was seized while sailing from a French port -- something Congress had not authorized -- the ship's owner sued. The Supreme Court decided in his favor, ruling that the president had no right to issue the order he did. John Marshall, the nation's greatest chief justice, declared that even in a time of hostilities, a president's decision to act militarily beyond what Congress had authorized was ''unlawful.''The court has repeatedly reinforced this principle. In 1952, in the steel seizure case, it ruled that President Harry Truman could not seize steel mills to avert a strike -- even though steel was needed for the Korean War -- because Congress had set out a different way of handling the labor unrest. More recently, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, it held that President Bush must follow Congressional guidelines when he sets up military tribunals for detainees.Past Congresses have enacted just the sort of restrictions the Bush administration is trying to foreclose today. During the Vietnam War, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 capped the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam at 4,000 within six months. The Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983 required the president to get Congress's approval for any substantial increase in the number or role of armed forces in Lebanon.There is little question that Congress could use its power of the purse to end a war. But cutting off financing is a drastic step, and one that members of Congress are understandably reluctant to take, because it can look like a refusal to support the troops. The Constitution's text, Supreme Court cases and history show, however, that Congress can instead pass laws that set the terms of military engagement. Whether it would be wise for Congress to adopt such limits is debatable; whether it has the authority to do so should not be.The Bush administration insists that if Congress tries to manage the Iraq war, it will leave the commander in chief with too little authority. But the greater danger is the one Madison recognized at the nation's founding -- that all the power will be left with the person ''most interested in war, and most prone to it.''Editorial ObserverThe Brookings Institution, the prominent Washington research organization, just released a report on the Iraq war entitled ''Things Fall Apart.'' When Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, took to the House floor last year to demand that President Bush present a plan for Iraq, he called his speech ''The Center Cannot Hold.'' Blogs are full of the observation that ''the blood-dimmed tide is loosed'' in Iraq these days.These phrases all come from William Butler Yeats's ''Second Coming.'' Yeats's bleakly apocalyptic poem has long been irresistible to pundits. What historical era, after all, is not neatly summed up by his lament that ''The best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity''? But with its somber vision of looming anarchy, and its Middle Eastern backdrop (the terrifying beast Yeats warns of ''slouches towards Bethlehem''), ''The Second Coming'' is fast becoming the official poem of the Iraq war.The pundits who quote it, though, are picking up on Yeats's words, but not his world view. As Helen Vendler, the great Harvard poetry scholar, and others have pointed out, ''The Second Coming'' is really two poems. The first eight lines are filled with the pointed aphorisms that pundits like so much, while the rest of the poem suggests the unpredictability of how history will unfold. This second, less quoted part is the one that speaks most directly to the grim situation in Iraq.Yeats wrote ''The Second Coming'' in 1919, an especially dismal moment in history. Europeans were shell-shocked from World War I, and deeply cynical. Yeats's homeland, Ireland, was lurching toward civil war. The old order in Russia had just been toppled by a revolution that Yeats -- who had a fondness for aristocracy -- feared would spread across the continent and the globe.Yeats's perspective on the world's troubles was not what many people who quote him today might suspect. For one thing, he was not a Christian. He dabbled in theosophy and the occult, and considered Christianity an idea whose time had passed. ''The Second Coming'' is not, as its title and the Bethlehem reference might suggest, an account of the return of the Messiah. What is being born is nothing resembling Christ.As for his politics, Yeats was hardly a democrat, and he did not care much for ''progress'' -- which makes him an odd choice for people who hope to turn Iraq into a vibrant democracy. Yeats was attracted to fascism, and he rebelled as a youth against the adults' talk of progress by embracing its opposite. ''I took satisfaction in certain public disasters, felt sort of ecstasy at the contemplation of ruin,'' he once wrote.The first eight lines of ''The Second Coming,'' as Ms. Vendler notes, are the philosophical part of the poem. A rational, thinking observer -- a pundit, of sorts -- is describing the world in definite, if foreboding, terms. ''The falcon cannot hear the falconer'' paints a vivid image of the natural order coming apart. ''Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world'' describes an onslaught of destruction almost matter-of-factly.But after those eight lines, the poem suddenly becomes, as Ms. Vendler notes, ''oracular.'' Like the Delphic oracle, this Yeats speaks cryptically. ''Surely the Second Coming is at hand,'' he says -- but of course, ''surely'' here means its opposite: what follows is not certain at all. Yeats goes on to announce ''somewhere in sands of the desert/ A shape with lion body and the head of a man'' -- an indefinite creature in an indefinite place.The poem reflects, as Harold Bloom, the Yale professor and literary critic, says, Yeats's belief that a ''change in god'' was coming, ''and that the 2,000-year reign of Christianity was about to end.'' But it does not reveal who this god will be. Its last two lines are a question: ''And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,/ Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?''''The Second Coming'' is a powerful brief against punditry. The Christian era was about the ability to predict the future: the New Testament clearly foretold the second coming of Christ. In the post-Christian era of which Yeats was writing there was no Bible to map out what the next ''coming'' would be. The world would have to look toward Bethlehem to see what ''rough beast'' arrived.This skepticism about predicting the future has more relevance to the Iraq war than any of the poem's much-quoted first eight lines. The story of the Iraq war is one of confident predictions that never came to pass: ''We will find weapons of mass destruction''; ''we will be greeted as liberators''; ''the insurgency is in its last throes.''The confident predictors who have been wrong in the past do not hesitate to keep offering up plans. That is true of President Bush, certainly: he talks about what his ''troop surge'' will do as if he had never been wrong before. It is also true of the pundits. The co-author of ''Things Fall Apart,'' the Brookings guide to going forward in Iraq, is Kenneth Pollack, who is -- incredibly -- best known for his 2002 book ''The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq.''It is bizarre to see shards of ''The Second Coming'' appended to the Brookings report, or to any of the other plans and prognostications about the war in Iraq. Yeats, who grew up feeling ''sort of ecstasy at the contemplation of ruin,'' did not just welcome whatever new order his rough beast was ushering in. He believed the only way it could plausibly be spoken of was in the form of a question.Editorial ObserverCarol Lam, the former United States attorney for San Diego, is smart and tireless and was very good at her job. Her investigation of Representative Randy Cunningham resulted in a guilty plea for taking more than $2 million in bribes from defense contractors and a sentence of more than eight years. Two weeks ago, she indicted Kyle Dustin Foggo, the former No. 3 official in the C.I.A. The defense-contracting scandal she pursued so vigorously could yet drag in other politicians.In many Justice Departments, her record would have won her awards, and perhaps a promotion to a top post in Washington. In the Bush Justice Department, it got her fired.Ms. Lam is one of at least seven United States attorneys fired recently under questionable circumstances. The Justice Department is claiming that Ms. Lam and other well-regarded prosecutors like John McKay of Seattle, David Iglesias of New Mexico, Daniel Bogden of Nevada and Paul Charlton of Arizona -- who all received strong job evaluations -- performed inadequately.It is hard to call what's happening anything other than a political purge. And it's another shameful example of how in the Bush administration, everything -- from rebuilding a hurricane-ravaged city to allocating homeland security dollars to invading Iraq -- is sacrificed to partisan politics and winning elections.U.S. attorneys have enormous power. Their decision to investigate or indict can bankrupt a business or destroy a life. They must be, and long have been, insulated from political pressures. Although appointed by the president, once in office they are almost never asked to leave until a new president is elected. The Congressional Research Service has confirmed how unprecedented these firings are. It found that of 486 U.S. attorneys confirmed since 1981, perhaps no more than three were forced out in similar ways -- three in 25 years, compared with seven in recent months.It is not just the large numbers. The firing of H. E. Cummins III is raising as many questions as Ms. Lam's. Mr. Cummins, one of the most distinguished lawyers in Arkansas, is respected by Republicans and Democrats alike. But he was forced out to make room for J. Timothy Griffin, a former Karl Rove deputy with thin legal experience who did opposition research for the Republican National Committee. (Mr. Griffin recently bowed to the inevitable and said he will not try for a permanent appointment. But he remains in office indefinitely.)The Bush administration cleared the way for these personnel changes by slipping a little-noticed provision into the Patriot Act last year that allows the president to appoint interim U.S. attorneys for an indefinite period without Senate confirmation.Three theories are emerging for why these well-qualified U.S. attorney were fired -- all political, and all disturbing.1. Helping friends. Ms. Lam had already put one powerful Republican congressman in jail and was investigating other powerful politicians. The Justice Department, unpersuasively, claims that it was unhappy about Ms. Lam's failure to bring more immigration cases. Meanwhile, Ms. Lam has been replaced with an interim prosecutor whose r√©sum√© shows almost no criminal law experience, but includes her membership in the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group.2. Candidate recruitment. U.S. attorney is a position that can make headlines and launch political careers. Congressional Democrats suspect that the Bush administration has been pushing out long-serving U.S. attorneys to replace them with promising Republican lawyers who can then be run for Congress and top state offices.3. Presidential politics. The Justice Department concedes that Mr. Cummins was doing a good job in Little Rock. An obvious question is whether the administration was more interested in his successor's skills in opposition political research -- let's not forget that Arkansas has been lucrative fodder for Republicans in the past -- in time for the 2008 elections.The charge of politics certainly feels right. This administration has made partisanship its lodestar. The Washington Post reporter Rajiv Chandrasekaran revealed in his book, ''Imperial Life in the Emerald City,'' that even applicants to help administer post-invasion Iraq were asked whom they voted for in 2000 and what they thought of Roe v. Wade.Congress has been admirably aggressive about investigating. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, held a tough hearing. And he is now talking about calling on the fired U.S. attorneys to testify and subpoenaing their performance evaluations -- both good ideas.The politicization of government over the last six years has had tragic consequences -- in New Orleans, Iraq and elsewhere. But allowing politics to infect U.S. attorney offices takes it to a whole new level. Congress should continue to pursue the case of the fired U.S. attorneys vigorously, both to find out what really happened and to make sure that it does not happen again.Editorial ObserverThe Bush administration has done a terrible job of explaining its decision to fire eight United States attorneys. Story after story has proved to be untrue: that the prosecutors who were fired were poor performers; that the White House was not involved in the purge. But the administration has been strangely successful in pushing its message that the scandal is at worst a political misdeed, not a criminal matter.It is true, as the White House keeps saying, that United States attorneys serve ''at the pleasure of the president,'' which means he can dismiss them whenever he wants. But if the attorneys were fired to interfere with a valid prosecution, or to punish them for not misusing their offices, that may well have been illegal.In law schools, it is common to give an exam called the ''issue spotter,'' in which students are given a set of facts and asked to identify all the legal issues and possible crimes. The facts about the purge are still emerging. But based on what is known -- and with some help from Congressional staff members and Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University -- it was not hard to spot that White House and Justice Department officials, and members of Congress, may have violated 18 U.S.C.  3/5sctmark1 4/5 3/5sctmark1 4/5 1501-1520, the federal obstruction of justice statute.Some crimes that a special prosecutor might one day look at:1. Misrepresentations to Congress. The relevant provision, 18 U.S.C.  3/5sctmark1 4/5 1505, is very broad. It is illegal to lie to Congress, and also to ''impede'' it in getting information. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty indicated to Congress that the White House's involvement in firing the United States attorneys was minimal, something that Justice Department e-mail messages suggest to be untrue.Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made his own dubious assertion to Congress: ''I would never, ever make a change in a United States attorney position for political reasons.''The administration appears to be trying to place all of the blame on Mr. Gonzales's chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, who resigned after reportedly failing to inform top Justice Department officials about the White House's role in the firings. If Mr. Sampson withheld the information from Mr. McNulty, who then misled Congress, Mr. Sampson may have violated  3/5sctmark1 4/5 1505.But Mr. Sampson's lawyer now says other top Justice Department officials knew of the White House's role. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, said last week that ''Kyle Sampson will not be the next Scooter Libby, the next fall guy.'' Congress will be looking for evidence that Mr. Gonzales and Mr. McNulty knew that what they told Congress was false or misleading.Convictions of this kind are not common, but they happen. Just ask former White House aide David Safavian, who was convicted last year of making false statements to a Senate committee.2. Calling the Prosecutors. As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley reforms, Congress passed an extremely broad obstruction of justice provision, 18 U.S.C.  3/5sctmark1 4/5 1512 (c), which applies to anyone who corruptly ''obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so,'' including U.S. attorney investigations.David Iglesias, the New Mexico United States attorney, says Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, called him and asked whether he intended to bring indictments in a corruption case against Democrats before last November's election. Mr. Iglesias said he ''felt pressured'' by the call. If members of Congress try to get a United States attorney to indict people he wasn't certain he wanted to indict, or try to affect the timing of an indictment, they may be violating the law.3. Witness Tampering. 18 U.S.C.  3/5sctmark1 4/5 1512 (b) makes it illegal to intimidate Congressional witnesses. Michael Elston, Mr. McNulty's chief of staff, contacted one of the fired attorneys, H. E. Cummins, and suggested, according to Mr. Cummins, that if he kept speaking out, there would be retaliation. Mr. Cummins took the call as a threat, and sent an e-mail message to other fired prosecutors warning them of it. Several of them told Congress that if Mr. Elston had placed a similar call to one of their witnesses in a criminal case, they would have opened an investigation of it.4. Firing the Attorneys. United States attorneys can be fired whenever a president wants, but not, as  3/5sctmark1 4/5 1512 (c) puts it, to corruptly obstruct, influence, or impede an official proceeding.Let's take the case of Carol Lam, United States attorney in San Diego. The day the news broke that Ms. Lam, who had already put one Republican congressman in jail, was investigating a second one, Mr. Sampson wrote an e-mail message referring to the ''real problem we have right now with Carol Lam.'' He said it made him think that it was time to start looking for a replacement. Congress has also started investigating the removal of Fred Black, the United States attorney in Guam, who was replaced when he began investigating the Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Anyone involved in firing a United States attorney to obstruct or influence an official proceeding could have broken the law.Much more needs to be learned, and Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who leads the Judiciary Committee, has been admirably firm about insisting that he will get sworn testimony from Karl Rove and other key players. It is far too soon to say that anyone committed a crime, and it may well be that no one has. But if this were a law school issue spotter, any student who could not identify any laws that may have been broken would get an ''F.''Editorial ObserverIn the summer of 1974, Richard Nixon bet his presidency on the doctrine of executive privilege, and lost. Nixon's lawyer, James St. Clair, argued to the Supreme Court that he did not have to give a special prosecutor the Watergate tape recordings of Nixon talking with various advisers. But in the oral argument, the justices were skeptical. Lewis Powell, the courtly Virginian, asked: ''Mr. St. Clair, what public interest is there in preserving secrecy with respect to a criminal conspiracy?''Justice Powell's question cut through Nixon's central claim: that executive privilege gives presidents an absolute right to keep their communications secret. Barely two weeks after the oral argument, the court unanimously ordered Nixon to turn over the tapes.Three decades later, the Bush administration is threatening to invoke executive privilege to hobble Congress's investigation into the purge of United States attorneys. President Bush has said that Karl Rove, his closest adviser, and Harriet Miers, his former White House counsel, among others, do not have to comply with Congressional subpoenas because ''the president relies upon his staff to give him candid advice.''This may well end up in a constitutional showdown. If it does, there is no question about which side should prevail. Congress has a right, and an obligation, to examine all of the evidence, which increasingly suggests that the Bush administration fired eight or more federal prosecutors either because they were investigating Republicans, or refusing to bring baseless charges against Democrats. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Watergate tapes case, and other legal and historical precedents, make it clear that executive privilege should not keep Congress from getting the testimony it needs.It's odd to hear President Bush invoke executive privilege because it is just the sort of judge-made right he has always claimed to oppose. Executive privilege is not mentioned in the Constitution, but judges have found it in the general principle of separation of powers. Presidents like to invoke it in sweeping ways, but the courts have been less enthusiastic.United States v. Nixon is the Supreme Court's major ruling on executive privilege. The first important principle that it established seems obvious, but it is not: that presidents cannot simply declare what information is privileged. Nixon argued, as Mr. Bush seems poised to, that presidents have an ''inherent authority to refuse to disclose.'' But the Supreme Court made it clear that as with other legal issues, courts, not presidents, have the final say on when executive privilege applies.The Nixon case's second important holding is that privilege claims are judged by a ''balancing test.'' The justices acknowledged that a president's ability to get candid advice is important. But they also factored in that in the case of the Watergate tapes, no military or diplomatic secrets were at stake. On the other side of the scales, the court said, were ''the inroads of such a privilege on the fair administration of criminal justice.'' The need for evidence, it concluded, was more important than the president's need for secrecy.There is one significant way in which Mr. Bush may have a stronger case. Nixon was resisting a criminal subpoena, while the subpoenas for Mr. Rove and the others would come from Congress. But in other ways, Mr. Bush's case is weaker. The Watergate tapes were recordings of a president's private discussions with top advisers, the essence of confidential presidential communications. Mr. Bush, by contrast, is trying to shield communications that occurred among members of his staff. It is hard to see how revealing these conversations would compromise his ability to get candid advice.There is also a strong argument that the Bush administration has already waived executive privilege because it has released extensive e-mail notes about the firings.If this dispute ends up in court, it is likely that Mr. Bush will lose on the balancing test. His interest in shielding communications among his staff members is weak, and there are no national security issues at stake. On the other hand, a court would probably find that Congress's interest in getting the testimony was considerable. If these prosecutors were fired to help Republicans win elections, such actions would be a dangerous politicization of the justice system that should get thorough scrutiny.President Bush is not only taking on legal precedents, but historical ones as well. When Congress has pressed for testimony, presidents have generally agreed, however reluctantly. Bruce Fein, the conservative legal commentator, urged Mr. Bush to cooperate, noting that President Ronald Reagan waived executive privilege in the Iran-contra inquiry and let national security advisers and cabinet secretaries testify.This administration could try to delay by challenging the subpoenas in court, a step that could be a drawn-out process. But it would then have another court to worry about: the court of public opinion. Monica Goodling, the Justice Department's liaison to the White House, has already invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination. If top advisers start to claim executive privilege, the American public is likely to suspect a cover-up.In the end, the public may be the harshest judge of all. Executive privilege claims now occur, as one law review article put it, ''in Nixon's shadow.'' Fairly or unfairly, Nixon, who resigned in disgrace shortly after the Supreme Court ruled, gave executive privilege a bad name, which it keeps to this day. If Mr. Bush battles Congress in court, he will be fighting not only legal precedents, but the nation's collective memory about the last president to take this stand.Editorial ObserverOpponents of Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin spent $4 million on ads last year trying to link the Democratic incumbent to a state employee who was sent to jail on corruption charges. The effort failed, and Mr. Doyle was re-elected -- and now the state employee has been found to have been wrongly convicted. The entire affair is raising serious questions about why a United States attorney put an innocent woman in jail.The conviction of Georgia Thompson has become part of the furor over the firing of eight United States attorneys in what seems like a political purge. While the main focus of that scandal is on why the attorneys were fired, the Thompson case raises questions about why other prosecutors kept their jobs.The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which heard Ms. Thompson's case this month, did not discuss whether her prosecution was political -- but it did make clear that it was wrong. And in an extraordinary move, it ordered her released immediately, without waiting to write a decision. ''Your evidence is beyond thin,'' Judge Diane Wood told the prosecutor. ''I'm not sure what your actual theory in this case is.''Members of Congress should ask whether it was by coincidence or design that Steven Biskupic, the United States attorney in Milwaukee, turned a flimsy case into a campaign issue that nearly helped Republicans win a pivotal governor's race.There was good reason for the appeals court to be shocked. Ms. Thompson, a 56-year-old single woman, seems to have lost her home and spent four months in prison simply for doing her job. Ms. Thompson, who spent years in the travel industry before becoming a state employee, was responsible for putting the state's travel account up for competitive bid. Mr. Biskupic claimed that she awarded the contract to an agency called Adelman Travel because its C.E.O. contributed to Mr. Doyle's campaign.To charge her, Mr. Biskupic had to look past a mountain of evidence of innocence. Ms. Thompson was not a Doyle partisan. She was a civil servant, hired by a Republican governor, with no identifiable interest in politics. She was only one member of a seven-person committee that evaluated the bidders. She was not even aware of the Adelman campaign contributions. She also had a good explanation for her choice: of the 10 travel agencies that competed, Adelman submitted the lowest-cost bid.While Ms. Thompson did her job conscientiously, that is less clear of Mr. Biskupic. The decision to award the contract -- the supposed crime -- occurred in Madison, in the jurisdiction of Wisconsin's other United States attorney. But for reasons that are hard to understand, the Milwaukee-based Mr. Biskupic swept in and took the case.While he was investigating, in the fall of 2005, Mr. Biskupic informed the media. Justice Department guidelines say federal prosecutors can publicly discuss investigations before an indictment only under extraordinary circumstances. This case hardly met that test.The prosecution proceeded on a schedule that worked out perfectly for the Republican candidate for governor. Mr. Biskupic announced Ms. Thompson's indictment in January 2006. She went to trial that summer, and was sentenced in late September, weeks before the election. Mr. Biskupic insisted in July, as he vowed to continue the investigation, that ''the review is not going to be tied to the political calendar.''But the Thompson case was ''the No. 1 issue'' in the governor's race, says the Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman, Joe Wineke. In a barrage of commercials, Mr. Doyle's opponents created an organizational chart that linked Ms. Thompson -- misleadingly called a ''Doyle aide'' -- to the governor. Ms. Thompson appeared in an unflattering picture, stamped ''guilty,'' and in another ad, her name was put on a graphic of jail-cell doors slamming shut.Most of the eight dismissed prosecutors came from swing states, and Democrats suspect they may have been purged to make room for prosecutors who would help Republicans win close elections. If so, it might also mean that United States attorneys in all swing states were under unusual pressure.Wisconsin may be the closest swing state of all. President Bush lost it in 2004 by about 12,000 votes, and in 2000, by about half that. According to some Wisconsin politicians, Karl Rove said that their state was his highest priority among governor's races in 2006, because he believed a Republican governor could help the party win Wisconsin in the 2008 presidential election.Mr. Biskupic insists that he prosecuted Ms. Thompson only because he believed a crime was committed, and that he did not discuss the political implications of the case or the timing with anyone in the Justice Department or the White House. Congress has asked the Justice Department for all e-mail messages about the case to help resolve the matter.But even if there were no discussions, Mr. Biskupic may have known that his bosses in Washington expected him to use his position to help Republicans win elections, and then did what they wanted.That would be ironic indeed. One of the biggest weaknesses in the case against Ms. Thompson was that to commit the crime she was charged with she had to have tried to gain personally from the contract, and there's no credible evidence that she did. So Mr. Biskupic made the creative argument that she gained by obtaining ''political advantage for her superiors'' and that in pleasing them she ''enhanced job security for herself.'' Those motivations, of course, may well describe why Mr. Biskupic prosecuted Ms. Thompson.Editorial ObserverThere is yet another United States attorney whose abrupt departure from office is raising questions: Debra Wong Yang of Los Angeles. Ms. Yang was not fired, as eight other prosecutors were, but she resigned under circumstances that raise serious questions, starting with whether she was pushed out to disrupt her investigation of one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress.If the United States attorney scandal has made one thing clear, it is that the riskiest job in the Bush administration is being a prosecutor investigating a Republican member of Congress. Carol Lam, the United States attorney in San Diego, was fired after she put Randy Cunningham, known as Duke, in prison. Paul Charlton, in Arizona, was dismissed while he was investigating Rick Renzi. Dan Bogden, in Nevada, was fired while he was reportedly investigating Jim Gibbons, a congressman who was elected governor last year.Ms. Yang was investigating Jerry Lewis, who was chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. Ms. Lam and most of the other purged prosecutors were fired on Dec. 7. Ms. Yang, in a fortuitously timed exit, resigned in mid-October.Ms. Yang says she left for personal reasons, but there is growing evidence that the White House was intent on removing her. Kyle Sampson, the Justice Department staff member in charge of the firings, told investigators last month in still-secret testimony that Harriet Miers, the White House counsel at the time, had asked him more than once about Ms. Yang. He testified, according to Congressional sources, that as late as mid-September, Ms. Miers wanted to know whether Ms. Yang could be made to resign. Mr. Sampson reportedly recalled that Ms. Miers was focused on just two United States attorneys: Ms. Yang and Bud Cummins, the Arkansas prosecutor who was later fired to make room for Tim Griffin, a Republican political operative and Karl Rove prot√©g√©.It is hard to see what put Ms. Yang on the White House list other than her investigation of Mr. Lewis, which threatened to pull in well-connected lobbyists, military contractors and Republican contributors. Ms. Yang, by all accounts, had a strong record. Alberto Gonzales hailed her as ''one of the most respected U.S. attorneys in the country.''The new job that Ms. Yang landed raised more red flags. Press reports say she got a $1.5 million signing bonus to become a partner in Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a firm with strong Republican ties. She was hired to be co-leader of the Crisis Management Practice Group with Theodore Olson, who was President Bush's solicitor general and his Supreme Court lawyer in Bush v. Gore. Gibson, Dunn was defending Mr. Lewis in Ms. Yang's investigation.Several issues bear investigating. First, did Ms. Yang know or suspect that she might lose her job, and jump ship to avoid being fired? That is not hard to believe because Ms. Miers and Mr. Sampson were exchanging e-mail about dismissing her in mid-September, and she announced her departure in October. Ms. Yang served on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, which Mr. Gonzales has called ''a small group of U.S. attorneys that I consult on policy matters.'' That may have put her in a position to be tipped off in advance.A second possibility is that Gibson, Dunn dangled a rich financial package before Ms. Yang to get her out, and to disrupt the investigation of Mr. Lewis. Ms. Yang, who says she left her job purely for personal reasons, may not have known she was being lured away by people with close ties to Mr. Lewis and the White House, who were hoping to replace her with a more partisan prosecutor.Another possibility is that the timing of her departure was coincidental. That would make her lucky indeed: after more than 15 years of working for government, she decided to take a private sector job precisely when the White House counsel was apparently trying to fire her.It is impossible to know how much of a setback Ms. Yang's departure was to the investigation of Mr. Lewis. It could be that it slowed down after she left. It could also be that it is going forward just as it would have had she stayed. If it has not been affected, that could be because the close attention Congress and the press are paying to United States attorneys has prevented the White House from installing a ''loyal Bushie,'' in Mr. Sampson's famous phrase.United States attorneys serve, as the White House likes to point out, at the pleasure of the president. But if Ms. Yang, or any of the others, was pushed out to prevent justice from being done in a pending criminal matter, it would be a serious misuse of executive authority. It could also be obstruction of justice.Congress is conducting closed-door interviews with Justice Department officials. That is important, but hardly enough. It is looking more and more as if the United States attorney dismissals were managed out of the White House. The way to put to rest the questions about Ms. Yang's suspicious departure, and the firings of the other prosecutors, is to require that Ms. Miers, Mr. Rove and other White House officials tell what they know, in public and under oath.Editorial ObserverMemorial Day got its start after the Civil War, when freed slaves and abolitionists gathered in Charleston, S.C., to honor Union soldiers who gave their lives to battle slavery. The holiday was so closely associated with the Union side, and with the fight for emancipation, that Southern states quickly established their own rival Confederate Memorial Day.Over the next 50 years, though, Memorial Day changed. It became a tribute to the dead on both sides, and to the reunion of the North and the South after the war. This new holiday was more inclusive, and more useful to a forward-looking nation eager to put its differences behind it. But something important was lost: the recognition that the Civil War had been a moral battle to free black Americans from slavery.In ''Race and Reunion,'' his masterful book about historical memory, David Blight, a professor at Yale, tells the wistful story of Memorial Day's transformation -- and what has been lost as a result. War commemorations, he makes clear, do not just pay tribute to the war dead. They also reflect a nation's understanding of particular wars, and they are edited for political reasons. Memorial Day is a day not only of remembering, but also of selective forgetting -- a point to keep in mind as the Iraq war moves uneasily into the history books.Many of the early Memorial Day commemorations, Professor Blight notes, were like Charleston's, paying tribute both to the fallen Union soldiers and to the emancipationist cause. At a ceremony in Maine in 1869, one fiery orator declared that ''the black stain of slavery has been effaced from the bosom of this fair land by martyr blood.''Less than a decade later in 1877 -- when Reconstruction ended in the South -- at New York City's enormous Memorial Day celebration, there was much talk of union, and almost none of slavery or race. The New York Herald declared that ''all the issues on which the war of rebellion was fought seem dead,'' and noted approvingly that ''American eyes have a characteristic tendency to look forward.''There were dissenting voices. Frederick Douglass, the great abolitionist leader, continued to insist that Memorial Day should be about the battle between ''slavery and freedom, barbarism and civilization.'' But the drive to make the holiday a generic commemoration of the Civil War dead won out.The new Memorial Day made it easier for Northern and Southern whites to come together, and it kept the focus where political and business leaders wanted it: on national progress. But it came at the expense of American blacks, whose status at the end of Reconstruction was precarious. If the Civil War was not a battle to determine whether a nation ''dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal'' could ''long endure,'' as Lincoln declared in the Gettysburg Address, but a mere regional dispute, there was no need to continue fighting for equal rights.And increasingly the nation did not. When Woodrow Wilson spoke at Gettysburg on the 50th anniversary of the battle, in a Memorial Day-like ceremony, he avoided the subject of slavery, Professor Blight notes, and declared ''the quarrel'' between North and South ''forgotten.'' The ceremony was segregated, and a week later Wilson's administration created separate white and black bathrooms in the Treasury Department. It would be another 50 years before the nation seriously took up the cause of racial equality again.Since 1913, Memorial Day has changed even more. It has expanded -- after World War I, it became a tribute to the dead of all the nation's wars -- while at the same time fading. Today, Memorial Day is little more than the start of summer, a time for barbecues and department store sales. Much would be gained, though, by going back to the holiday's original meanings.When Memorial Day began, the war dead were placed front and center. The holiday's original name, Decoration Day, came from the day's main activity: leaving flowers at cemeteries. Today, though, we are fighting a war in which great pains have been taken to hide the nearly 3,500 Americans who have died from sight. The Defense Department has banned the photographing of returning caskets, and the president refuses to attend soldiers' funerals.Memorial Day also began with the conviction that to properly honor the war dead, it is necessary to honestly contemplate the cause for which they fought. Today we are fighting a war sold on false pretenses, and the Bush administration stands by its false stories. Memorial Day's history, and its devolution, demonstrates that the instinct to prettify war and create myths about it is hardly new.But as the founders of the original Memorial Day understood, the only honorable way to remember those who have lost their lives is to commemorate them out in the open, and to insist on a true account.Editorial ObserverIn the last 100 Supreme Court arguments, Clarence Thomas has not uttered a word. Court watchers have suggested a variety of explanations. Among the least flattering: he is afraid that if he speaks he will reveal his ignorance about the case; he is so ideologically driven that he invariably comes with his mind made up; or he has contempt for the process.In their provocative new book, ''Supreme Discomfort: The Divided Soul of Clarence Thomas,'' two Washington Post journalists, Kevin Merida and Michael Fletcher, ponder Justice Thomas's extraordinary silence, and many other puzzles. They offer a wealth of insight, but they have no answer to the central enigma he poses: why the justice who has faced the greatest hardships regularly rules for the powerful over the weak, and has a legal philosophy notable for its indifference to suffering.It is a particularly timely question. For 15 years, Justice Thomas was a marginal figure, rarely assigned to write major opinions because his views were so far right that he would have had trouble attracting five votes. But Justice Thomas is a lot less marginal with the recent changes in the court -- particularly the replacement of Sandra Day O'Connor, a moderate conservative, with Samuel Alito, a more extreme one. He appears poised in the next few weeks to achieve his longstanding goal: dismantling the integrationist vision of his predecessor Thurgood Marshall.Justice Thomas's early years were not as hardscrabble as his image-makers suggested during his confirmation; he left tiny Pin Point, Ga., young, and was raised in a middle-class home. But he grew up in the Jim Crow South, with an absent father and an often-absent mother. He spent much of his childhood, the authors say, being ''angry and hurt.''In college and law school, he identified strongly with his fellow blacks, and was liberal, even radical, on racial issues. But as he accepted jobs from Republicans eager to hire a conservative black lawyer, he shifted rightward. As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, his phlegmatic advocacy for victims of discrimination disappointed civil rights activists, while impressing conservatives looking for a replacement for Justice Marshall.His confirmation hearings, at which Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment, put an even sharper edge on his ideology. He redirected his anger, much of which had been aimed at whites, at liberals and civil rights organizations. Justice Thomas is now beloved on the far right, with friends like Rush Limbaugh, whose wedding he performed.Justice Thomas wasted no time unveiling his harsh jurisprudence. In his first year on the court, he dissented from a decision holding that the ban on cruel and unusual punishment may have been violated when guards kicked a prisoner and punched him in the stomach, eye, and mouth. The prisoner had a split lip, bruises and loosened teeth, but Justice Thomas insisted that the Constitution did not prohibit such ''insignificant harm.'' He dissented from a ruling in favor of a prisoner who was handcuffed to a hitching post in the hot sun for seven hours while a guard taunted him about his thirst.Justice Thomas also dissented from rulings that the mentally retarded and juveniles could not be executed. He can be counted on to reflexively oppose discrimination claims of minorities and women, as he did last week, when he joined the majority in rejecting the claim of a woman who was underpaid for years because of her sex, on the dubious ground that she complained too late.Justice Thomas claims he is simply faithful to the ''original intent'' of the founders. But when the founders' intent is not involved -- as in the pay discrimination case, which was based on a modern statute -- he is just as quick to reach a harsh result.When Justice Thomas joined the court, he not only filled Justice Marshall's seat, he also labored in his shadow. As a lawyer in Brown v. Board of Education, Justice Marshall had persuaded the court to champion racial integration. When he arrived on the court in 1967, he pushed it in a humane direction not only on race, but also in areas like prisoners' and women's rights and fair elections. The court had largely stopped moving forward in these areas by the time Justice Thomas arrived but, mainly due to Justice O'Connor, it did not move backward that much, either.That appears likely to change. The court heard arguments this term challenging Louisville's and Seattle's voluntary efforts to integrate their schools. The court has long upheld voluntary attempts to bring students of different backgrounds together, including, just a few years ago, the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. But this time, it is expected to strike down Seattle's and Louisville's, which is likely to make public schools much more segregated. With its new members, the court is also likely to make prisons less civilized, and workplaces, elections and criminal trials less fair.When Justice Marshall retired, Justice O'Connor noted that he ''imparted not only his legal acumen but also his life experiences'' and made the court respond not only to his arguments but to ''moral truth.'' America will be a much less just place if Justice Thomas's life experiences and moral truth start to shape the court's agenda -- and the nation's.Editorial Observer
