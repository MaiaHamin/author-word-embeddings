A surge in the number of troops in Iraq might have helped in 2003 or early 2004.But in 2007, President Bush's plan seems to represent a warmed-over variant of approaches that have already been tried and mostly failed, that are opposed by some top American military commanders and ordinary Iraqis alike, and whose most likely outcome will be many more Americans in body bags or wheelchairs.The reality is that we've already tried surges. There was one of 20,000 troops in early 2004, a similar one in the fall of 2005, and one a bit smaller in the summer of 2006.As recently as July, Mr. Bush cheerily described a plan ''to deploy additional American troops and Iraqi security personnel in Baghdad in the coming weeks.'' He explained that this would ''bring greater security to the Iraqi capital  [and] root out those who instigate violence.''By October, Maj. Gen. William Caldwell, the chief U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, was acknowledging that the recent troop increases ''had not met our overall expectations of sustaining a reduction in the levels of violence.''Proponents of escalation cite the example of Tal Afar, a town in northwestern Iraq. U.S. forces there have met some genuine success since September 2005 with the ''clear, build and hold'' strategy that Mr. Bush apparently now favors for Baghdad.But Tal Afar is only about one-thirtieth the size of Baghdad, and it isn't even Arab: its people are mostly members of the Turkmen minority. Trying to replicate that (limited) success in Baghdad is a fool's errand.In Tal Afar, there was one U.S. soldier for every 40 residents. Using the same ratio in Baghdad would require 150,000 troops, sustained for more than a year. That's impossible.Mr. Bush's surge may be just big enough to expose more troops to danger and to let the Iraqi government off the hook, without being big enough to achieve security.Don Rumsfeld was wrong on just about everything in Iraq -- except the downside of additional troops there: ''More forces, U.S. and coalition forces, create the impression of an occupation,'' he said. Indeed, any expansion of our military presence is likely to bolster anti-American radicals, like Moktada al-Sadr.Sure, Iraq promises to help in the crackdown. But my bet is that -- once again -- Iraqi leaders will make big pledges and then let us do the heavy lifting.In any case, sending in even more young Americans won't help counterinsurgency efforts when, according to an American-sponsored poll conducted in September, 78 percent of Iraqis believe that the American troop presence is ''provoking more conflict than it is preventing.'' That's why Iraqis overwhelmingly favor a timetable for a U.S. withdrawal, and it's one reason I do as well.Mr. Bush is right about the risks of withdrawal: our pullout could be followed by a vast bloodbath and by a regional war in which Iran backs Iraqi Shiite militias and Saudi Arabia and Jordan back Iraqi Sunnis (with Turkey marching into Kurdistan). But all that may unfold anyway, and the prospect of withdrawal may be the best hope to galvanize Iraqi factions to take steps to avert such a catastrophe.If Mr. Bush succeeds in escalating our military involvement, it's almost inevitable that many more Americans will be killed and injured. The focus has been on fatalities, but by some counts there have been 16 American service injuries for every death. That's partly a tribute to improvements in military medicine, for in Vietnam there were 2.6 injuries per American fatality.All told, between 22,000 and 50,000 Americans have been injured so far in Iraq (depending on who does the counting); the higher number is one-third as many as in the entire Vietnam War. Linda Bilmes, a Harvard scholar who has written a new report on the war injuries, notes that the backlog for veterans' disability claims has risen more than fivefold since 2000, and she cites horror stories like that of a staff sergeant who suffered severe brain injuries and then had his pay stopped and utilities cut because of a bureaucratic error.''If the new Congress really wants to support our troops,'' Ms. Bilmes writes, ''it should start by spending a few more pennies on the ones who have already fought and come home.''That's a responsibility Mr. Bush should assume as well. And when he speaks to the nation to urge more troops in Iraq, he needs to explain why the back alleys of Baghdad are the best places to invest additional buckets of American blood.Op-Ed ColumnistWith Iraq sliding off a cliff, and now tugging another 20,000 young Americans along as well, it's worth wrestling with a larger question: Why are we so awful at foreign policy?Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer who won the Nobel Peace Prize, dropped by the other day, and she made the same point with characteristic bluntness. ''It amazes me that the U.S., with all its scientific accomplishments, is so shortsighted in its foreign policy,'' she noted.It is pathetic. We can go safely to the moon but not to Anbar Province. We can peer into the farthest reaches of the universe, but we fail to notice (until it's too late) that many Iraqis loathe us. We produce movies that delight audiences all over the world, but we can't devise a foreign policy that anybody likes.And it's not just right-wing Republicans who are the problem. President Bush has been particularly myopic, but Democrats mired us in Vietnam: shortsightedness is a bipartisan tradition in foreign policy. Historically, we are often our own worst enemy.Iraq is the example of the moment. We invaded, thinking that we would get a pro-American bulwark, cheap oil, long-term military bases and the gratitude of liberated Iraqis. Instead, we fought Iraq, and Iran won.Speaking of which, look at Iran. In 1953, we helped overthrow the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, to achieve a more pro-Western government. That created tensions that led to the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the rise of mullahs with nuclear dreams. If it weren't for our own policies, Iran might well now have a pro-American government.So why do we act so often against our own long-term interests? There are at least two reasons.The first is that great powers always lumber about, stepping on toes, provoking resentments, and solving problems militarily simply because they have that capability. One of the great passages of Thucydides records how some 2,400 years ago Athens decided to wipe out the city of Melos because it could.Likewise, in 1955, when Britain was the dominant player in the Middle East, it formed the Baghdad Pact, a military arrangement intended to protect British interests in the Middle East. Instead, the arrangement inflamed Arab nationalists, strengthened anti-British feeling and contributed to the fall of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958 -- and, eventually, to the rise of Saddam.The second reason is particular to the U.S.: We don't understand the world. The U.S. may owe its existence to prickly nationalist troublemakers like Sam Adams, but (partly because relatively few Americans have lived abroad) we are obtuse about the appeal of prickly nationalist troublemakers elsewhere. Like George III, we empower our enemies.So what does all this have to do with the price of tea in Baghdad?Once again the White House is seeking military solutions that are likely to rebound and hurt us. Sending more young Americans into that maelstrom may well have three consequences: inflaming Iraqi nationalism, bolstering Shiite and Sunni extremists alike, and killing more young Americans.A U.S. military study in 1999, recently declassified and in the National Security Archive, concluded that even 400,000 American troops might not be able to stabilize a post-Saddam Iraq. The study emphasized the importance of diplomacy to engage Iraq's neighbors.But President Bush is moving in the opposite direction. Most worrying, he is hinting at engaging Syria and Iran not diplomatically but militarily. We are careering down a road that may ultimately lead to military strikes on Iran -- a disaster.What would a better strategy look like? A good bit like the one advocated by the Iraq Study Group. It would emphasize engaging neighbors, a big push for political compromises within Iraq, steps toward troop withdrawals and an intensive effort to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace. (Condi Rice is planning this last effort.)Would this strategy work in Iraq? No one knows. But such a bipartisan plan might at least bring a bit of healing to the U.S.Meanwhile, history comes around in other ways. The Rev. Bob Edgar, the general secretary of the National Council of Churches, recalls that as a young congressman in April 1975, he encountered a similar presidential request for a surge of troops. It was a demand by President Gerald Ford for more U.S. forces to stabilize Saigon.A White House photo captures Ford conferring with two of the architects of that request: senior administration officials named Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.Op-Ed ColumnistGenocide may be the worst of crimes, but historically it has also brought out the best in some people.The Raoul Wallenbergs of 2007 speckle America and the globe. And I don't just mean the aid workers -- 13 of whom have been murdered for their efforts in Darfur since last May -- but also those ordinary Americans who have united in a grass-roots campaign to try to stop genocide half a world away in Sudan.President Bush and other world leaders have dropped the ball on Darfur. But that vacuum of moral leadership has been filled by university students, churches and temples, celebrities like George Clooney and Mia Farrow, and armies of schoolchildren.Their arsenal -- green armbands, phone calls to the White House, bake sales to raise money -- all seem pallid. How can a ''Save Darfur'' lawn sign in Peoria intimidate government-backed raiders in Sudan or Chad who throw babies into bonfires?Yet, finally, we see evidence that those armbands and lawn signs can make a difference. Last week, the Save Darfur Coalition -- the grass-roots organization that puts out those lawn signs -- sponsored a trip by Bill Richardson, the New Mexico governor, to Khartoum to negotiate with President Omar al-Bashir.Sure, it's a little weird when a private advocacy group undertakes freelance diplomacy. But if George W. Bush, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and Hu Jintao twiddle their thumbs, then more power to the freelancers.Mr. Richardson worked out a joint statement in which Sudan agreed to a 60-day cease-fire to allow peace talks to resume, provided the Darfur rebels go along as well. Mr. Bashir also agreed that Sudan would prosecute rapes and stop painting its military aircraft to look as if they belong to the U.N.The first thing to say is that Mr. Bashir has repeatedly broken his pledges in the past. Count me deeply skeptical about whether it will be any different this time. Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, a Sudanese human rights campaigner, told me he thinks that President Bashir simply made cosmetic concessions in hopes of winning the chairmanship of the African Union later this month.That said, there may be a path forward here. While U.N. peacekeepers and a no-fly zone are needed, ultimately the only way to end the slaughter is to achieve a peace agreement in Darfur. And that seems more feasible today than it was a week ago.Most striking, it's clear that the cease-fire was a consequence of all those armbands and lawn signs. Mr. Richardson told me that Mr. Bashir was motivated by concern at the way the killings have been spotlighted by Darfur activists. Mr. Richardson quoted him as saying, ''These guys have caused me a lot of damage.''Ken Bacon, who heads Refugees International and accompanied Mr. Richardson, said of President Bashir: ''One thing that was very clear was that the Save Darfur movement has gotten under his skin. The vilification of the Khartoum regime in columns and editorials and ads is making a difference.''So cherish this historical moment. The long record of genocide is one overwhelmingly of acquiescence, but this time ordinary citizens are trying to write a different ending.There are the students at Santa Clara University in California who replicated a mini refugee camp and slept in it. They limited themselves to 1,000 calories a day -- because that's what Darfuris are limited to -- and donated the savings to aid groups.Or there's Jason Miller, a California M.D./Ph.D student who in his spare time has become the foremost expert on how investments by foreign companies underwrite the Sudanese genocide. Or Beth Reilly, a stay-at-home mom in Indiana who works on Darfur a little bit every day. Or the legions of schoolkids who organize car washes, and ask for donations in lieu of birthday presents, in hopes of saving other children halfway around the globe.Sudan's leaders are used to bullying everyone. Jan Pronk, who was the United Nations envoy in Sudan until Khartoum ejected him, reports in his Weblog that a U.N. official recently went to the authorities in Darfur to complain about human rights violations. A Sudanese official retorted: ''You better shut up. We can always expel you, as we have proven.''But finally President Bashir is confronting people whom he can't bully. Let's have no illusions about how much more pressure will be necessary to stop the slaughter, but let's also celebrate this moment. Mr. Bashir has blinked, showing that it just may be possible to fight genocide with moral courage and lawn signs.One of the most worrying parts of President Bush's Iraq strategy doesn't have anything to do with Iraq. It's the way he's ramping up a confrontation with Iran.Across a broad spectrum of policy levers, Mr. Bush is raising the pressure on Iran, increasing the risk that he will drag the U.S. into a third war in an Islamic country in six years. Instead of disengaging from war, he could end up starting another.We could have taken another route. In 2003, Iran sent the U.S. a detailed message offering to work together to capture terrorists, to stabilize Iraq, to resolve nuclear disputes, to withdraw military support for Hezbollah and Hamas, and to moderate its position on Israel, in exchange for the U.S. lifting sanctions and warming up to Iran.Some diplomats liked the idea, but administration hawks rejected it at once. Lawrence Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, says that the State Department sent a cable to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran, who looks after U.S. interests in Iran, scolding him for even forwarding the package to Washington.Obviously, Iran's offer might have led nowhere. But it's plain where rejection of the offer has taken us: more Americans are dying in Iraq, and some experts worry about clashes with Iran itself.The Iraq Study Group proposed engagement with Iran, but instead Mr. Bush has been escalating the rhetoric and military pressure.''When you have such a buildup and have zero communications, and you have an arena like Iraq where you may step on each other's toes, you could have rapid escalation,'' warns Vali Nasr, an expert on the region at the Naval Postgraduate School.It doesn't appear that Mr. Bush wants a war with Iran. His aim seems to be a show of force to deter Iran and reassure our allies in the region. But he is on a path that may easily lead to escalation.It's unfortunate that we are ratcheting up the military pressure, because the administration has quietly taken one very useful step against Iran: squeezing its access to international banking transactions. That has caused real economic pain and has added to the unpopularity of Iran's hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Those banking sanctions, not military moves, are a reason Mr. Ahmadinejad has been rebuked by the country's supreme leader.Unfortunately, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Ahmadinejad benefit from confrontation. Both are unpopular domestically but can use a crisis to distract from their policy failures.''The current strategy benefits Ahmadinejad,'' says Professor Nasr. ''It's going to divert attention at the popular level from democracy.''Mr. Ahmadinejad is facing growing criticism: he has been heckled by university students and scolded in the press, and his candidates did poorly in recent elections. Ordinary Iranians love the U.S. -- it's the most pro-American country in the Middle East I've visited -- and a civil society is struggling to be born.''If there is any military strike on Iran, all this movement will end,'' said Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize winner.Even some Republicans opposed to a ''grand bargain'' favor some kind of engagement. Mitchell Reiss, a former senior State Department official under Mr. Bush, proposes technical talks with Iran about drug trafficking and maritime security. ''Even if they are a nonstarter for Tehran, I think we score points in the region for trying,'' Ambassador Reiss said.Granted, Mr. Bush is right to be frustrated by Iran and the way it's defying the international community with its nuclear program.Unfortunately, Mr. Bush's military pressure may end up making Iraq bloodier than ever. Instead of being cowed, Iran may use its proxies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and elsewhere to kill more American officials and troops.Or even ordinary Americans here at home. ''It's a pretty good assumption that they have, if not operatives, at least sympathetic actors and affiliated groups'' in the U.S., said Henry Crumpton, the State Department coordinator for counterterrorism.Mr. Bush is absolutely right to denounce Iran's leaders for stealing elections, suppressing their people and dabbling in terrorism. But we ourselves are partly to blame for the awful government in Tehran.By instigating a coup in 1953 and seeking special legal privileges for American troops in 1964, we empowered extremists like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and allowed them to tap nationalist outrage. So it would be in keeping with tradition if Mr. Bush, by shortsightedly stoking a confrontation with Tehran, now inadvertently helped Iranian hard-liners crush Iran's democracy movement.Op-Ed ColumnistMaybe George W. Bush is the education president after all. Whatever one thinks of his No Child Left Behind initiative, he has made the classics powerfully resonant today.So for those schoolchildren and university students out there struggling through ''Moby-Dick'' or the ''Aeneid,'' take heart! They're not just about white whales or Trojan wanderers -- they're also about President Bush and Iraq.Forget the Vietnam analogy that critics of the Iraq war usually toss out. A more trenchant analysis of Iraq-style adventures appears in the histories of Thucydides, written 2,400 years ago.Great Athenian diplomats of the day, like Nicias, warned against military involvement in Sicily, calling it ''a war that does not concern us,'' according to Thucydides. But smooth-talking neocons of the day, like the brilliant Alcibiades, said in effect that the Sicilians would welcome the Athenians with flowers. He promised that they would be treated not as occupiers but as liberators.''We shall have many barbarians  join us,'' Alcibiades declared, and he argued that the enemy would be easily defeated ''rabble.'' ''Never were the Peloponnesians more hopeless against us,'' he told the crowds.So the Athenians rallied around the flag and dispatched a huge force. But as Thucydides notes, they had suffered a grievous intelligence failure: they did not get the support they had counted on, and the enemy was far larger and more organized than they had anticipated. The war went badly, and eventually Athens was forced to confront two options: withdraw or escalate.The Athenians, deciding that defeat was not an option, went with the ''surge.'' They dispatched an additional 70-odd ships and 5,000 troops.The result was a catastrophic defeat. Thousands of Athenians were killed far from home, and others were sold into slavery. The Athenian navy was destroyed, and the double-or-nothing gambit meant that other nonaligned states sided with the Athenians' enemy, Sparta.Within a few years, Athenian democracy had collapsed, and Athens, the great city-state of the ancient world, had been conquered by Sparta.President Bush has lent a new thrill to readers of Virgil's account of the adventures of Aeneas from Troy to Rome. A marvelous new translation of the ''Aeneid,'' by Robert Fagles, has just been published, and critics (and Professor Fagles himself) have noted its relevance: Virgil is suddenly newsy.That's because this is a tale of war and empire, and a constant subtext is how easy it is to be uncivilized when promoting civilization.Aeneas is an exponent of reason who at the end of the book confronts an enemy who pleads with him to ''go no further down the road of hatred.'' Aeneas sees that the enemy is wearing the sword-belt of his slain friend, and reason dissolves into fury: ''Blazing with wrath,'' he plants his iron sword ''hilt-deep in his enemy's heart.'' In war, moderation is the first casualty.Yet the single best guide to Mr. Bush's presidency may be ''Moby-Dick.'' Melville's book is, of course, about much more than Captain Ahab's pursuit of the white whale -- a ''nameless, inscrutable, unearthly'' symbol of all that is dark and unknown in the world.Rather, it is an allegory about the cost of obsession. Ahab has a reasonable goal, capturing a whale, yet he allows this quest to overwhelm him and erode his sense of perspective and balance. Ignoring warnings, refusing to admit error, Ahab abandons all rules and limits in his quest.Ahab finally throws his pipe overboard; he will enjoy no pleasures until he gets that whale. The fanaticism becomes self-destructive, eventually destroying Ahab and his ship.To me at least, Melville captures the trajectory of the Bush years. It begins with a president who started out after 9/11 with immense support at home and abroad and a genuine mandate to fight terrorism. But then Mr. Bush became obsessed by his responsibility to prevent another terror attack.This was an eminently worthy goal, but Mr. Bush abandoned traditional rules and boundaries -- like bans on torture and indefinite detentions -- and eventually blundered into Iraq. And in a way that Melville could have foretold, the compulsive search for security ended up creating insecurity.Melville's lesson is that even a heroic quest can be destructive when we abandon all sense of limits. And at a time when we hear the siren calls of moral clarity, the classics almost invariably emphasize the importance of moral nuance, an appreciation for complexity, the need for humility.So, students, study those classics. They are timeless -- and in the days of the Iraq war and Guantánamo, they have never been more timely.Op-Ed ColumnistOver the next two days, African leaders will convene in Ethiopia and choose a new head of the African Union. Incredibly, that job may go to Sudan's blood-drenched president, Omar al-Bashir, architect of the genocide in Darfur.The outcome is still uncertain, with Sudan campaigning furiously for the job, but it's mind-boggling that African countries would even consider selecting as their leader a man who has systematically dispatched militias that pick out babies on the basis of tribe and skin color and throw them into bonfires.At a time when Africa is enjoying solid economic growth and improved leadership, this self-inflicted wound would sully Africa's image and make it far more difficult for African Union peacekeepers to save lives in Darfur.Mr. Bashir hasn't confined himself to killing his own people, but has also sent his janjaweed militias to invade Chad and the Central African Republic. The janjaweed have beaten mothers with their own babies, until the infants are dead, and lately they have diversified into gouging out people's eyes with bayonets. For anyone who wants the best for Africa, it is repulsive to think of President Bashir as the duly elected spokesman for the continent.One reason Mr. Bashir has continued to engage in such behavior is that the world doesn't seriously object. Almost all North African countries are backing his bid to chair the African Union. China, which supplies nearly all the AK-47s that are used to kill children in Darfur, has underwritten the genocide. Lately, it has encouraged Sudan to be more responsible, but President Hu Jintao is visiting Sudan shortly -- let's see whether he publicly expresses concern about Chinese-supported atrocities in Africa that far exceed the Rape of Nanjing.Sudan promised a cease-fire, but instead it has been attacking aid workers. As Newsweek reported, at least four female aid workers have been beaten and sexually abused recently -- raped in the case of two French women.In addition, an aid worker in Sudan tells me that on Jan. 22 the police raided a party in the city of Nyala and arrested 22 employees of aid groups. Several were beaten and one woman was sexually abused but managed to fend off an attempted rape.Broader security is also collapsing. On a road near Bulbul that used to be safe, gunmen stopped a public bus in the middle of the day and brutally beat the men and gang-raped the women for hours. In the face of all this, aid workers are jittery and some are pulling out.Yet Europe is oblivious (the Davos conference here has great sessions on Africa but nothing on Darfur). President Bush has been better than most world leaders, but still pathetic: he mustered half a sentence in his State of the Union address. Perhaps this is because Mr. Bush regards the situation as tragic but hopeless, but in fact there is plenty he could do.He could speak out forcefully about Darfur. He could bring victims to the White House for a photo op. He could help the U.N. send a force to protect Chad and the Central African Republic -- while continuing to push for U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur itself. He could visit Darfur or Chad and invite European or Chinese officials to join him. He could invite African leaders to Washington for a summit meeting that would include discussion of Darfur. He could impose a no-fly zone. He could develop targeted sanctions against Sudanese leaders. He could begin forensic accounting to find assets of those leaders in Western countries. He could call on NATO and the Pentagon to prepare contingency plans in case the janjaweed start massacring the hundreds of thousands of Darfuris in camps.And this weekend he could telephone a few African presidents to tell them what a catastrophe it would be if Africa chose Mr. Bashir as its leader.Serious negotiations between the government and Darfur's rebels are crucial for a lasting peace deal in Darfur, and new discussions are expected soon (that may be why President Hu dares visit Khartoum). But Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, a Sudanese human rights leader, says the new talks will fail unless the Darfur rebels have a chance to consult first. And when they try to meet, the Sudanese government bombs them.There are countless other practical ideas for Darfur, and I'd like to hear yours. Send your suggestions to me at DarfurSuggestions@gmail.com. I'll post some on my blog at www.nytimes.com/ontheground and discuss them in a future column.Op-Ed ColumnistThe World Economic Forum here in Davos is the kind of place where if you let yourself get distracted while walking by a European prime minister on your left, you could end up tripping over a famous gazillionaire -- and then spilling your coffee onto the king on your right. But perhaps the most remarkable people to attend aren't the world leaders or other bigwigs.Rather, they are the social entrepreneurs. Davos, which has always been uncanny in peeking just ahead of the curve to reflect the zeitgeist of the moment, swarmed with them.So what's a social entrepreneur? Let me give a few examples among those at the forum in Davos.In Africa, where children die of diarrhea from bad sanitation, Isaac Durojaiye runs a franchise system for public toilets. He supplies mobile toilets to slum areas, where unemployed young people charge a small fee for their use. The operators keep 60 percent of the income and pass the rest back to Mr. Durojaiye's company, Dignified Mobile Toilets, which uses the money to buy new toilets.Nic Frances runs a group that aims to cut carbon emissions in 70 percent of Australian households over 10 years. His group, Easy Being Green, gives out low-energy light bulbs and low-flow shower heads -- after the household signs over the rights to the carbon emissions the equipment will save. The group then sells those carbon credits to industry to finance its activities, and it is now aiming to expand globally.In the U.S., Gillian Caldwell and her group, Witness, train people around the world to use video cameras to document human rights abuses. The resulting videos have drawn public attention to issues like child soldiers and the treatment of the mentally ill. Now Ms. Caldwell aims to create a sort of YouTube for human rights video clips.Social entrepreneurs like Ms. Caldwell resemble traditional do-gooders in their yearning to make the world a better place, but sound like chief executives when they talk about metrics to assess cost-effectiveness. Many also generate income to finance expansion.''We're totally self-sustaining,'' said Mirai Chatterjee, a dynamo who is coordinator of the Self-Employed Women's Association in India. ''From Day 1 our idea was to run a strong economic organization.'' Ms. Chatterjee's organization now has nearly 1 million members, owns a bank, runs 100 day care centers, trains midwives and provides health insurance for 200,000 women. It is empowering women and fighting poverty across a growing swath of rural India, and its down-to-earth approach is characteristic of social entrepreneurs.''Politics is failing to solve all the big issues,'' said Jim Wallis, who wrote ''God's Politics'' and runs Sojourners, which pushes social justice issues. ''So when that happens, social movements rise up.''Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, demonstrated with Grameen Bank the power of microfinancing. His bank has helped raise incomes, secure property rights for women, lower population growth and raise education standards across Bangladesh -- and now the success is rippling around the globe.One of those inspired by Mr. Yunus, for example, was Roshaneh Zafar, a young Pakistani economist. She quit her job and started Kashf, a microfinance institution that now gives hundreds of thousands of Pakistani women a route out of poverty.Ms. Zafar also received help from Ashoka, a hugely influential organization for social entrepreneurs started by an American, Bill Drayton (who describes social entrepreneurs as ''the most important historical force at work today''). Ashoka is one of a growing number of donor groups that offer the equivalent of venture capital for social entrepreneurs.''The key with social entrepreneurs is their pragmatic approach,'' said Pamela Hartigan of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, which is affiliated with the World Economic Forum. ''They're not out there with protest banners; they're actually developing concrete solutions.''When I travel around the world, I'm blown away by how these people are transforming lives. A growing number of the best and brightest university graduates in the U.S. and abroad are moving into this area (many clutching the book ''How to Change the World,'' a bible in the field).It's one of the most hopeful and helpful trends around. These folks aren't famous, and they didn't fly to Davos in first-class cabins or private jets, but they are showing that what it really takes to change the world isn't so much wealth or power as creativity, determination and passion.Op-Ed ColumnistDick Cheney as Lord Voldemort?A reader named Melissa S. e-mailed to say that she explains Iraq policy to her 8-year-old son in terms of Harry Potter characters: ''Dick Cheney is Lord Voldemort. George W. Bush is Peter Pettigrew.'' Don Rumsfeld is Lucius Malfoy, while Cornelius Fudge represents administration supporters who deny that anything is wrong. And, she concludes, ''Daily Prophet reporter Rita Skeeter is Fox News.''That was one of the 400 comments from readers offering literary or historical parallels to the Bush administration and Iraq. One of the most commonly cited was Xenophon's ancient warning, in ''Anabasis,'' of how much easier it is to get into a Middle Eastern war than out.As a reader named John H. summarized ''Anabasis'': ''Ten thousand Greek mercenaries march from Greece to Iran to effect regime change (unseat one emperor and establish his younger brother). They win the first few battles (cakewalk, mission accomplished) but then the younger brother is killed.''So the invaders found themselves without an effective prime minister to hand power to, yet they were stuck deep inside enemy territory. Xenophon's subtext is how the slog of war corrodes soldiers and allows them to do terrible things. Xenophon is particularly pained when recounting a massacre that was the Haditha of its day.The readers who sent in comments were responding to a column I wrote last month arguing that President Bush is inadvertently a fine education president, because he breathes new life into the classics. Thucydides' account of the failed ''surge'' in the Sicilian expedition 2,400 years ago is newly relevant, and ''Moby Dick'' is interesting reading today as a bracing warning of the dangers of an obsessive adventure that casts aside all rules. (You can submit your own favorite literary or historical parallel at nytimes.com/ontheground.)Perhaps I'm cherry-picking from the classics to support my own opposition to a ''surge'' in Iraq. In writing this column, I wondered what classics Mr. Bush's supporters would cite to argue for his strategy. Shakespeare's ''Henry V''? ''Hamlet''?Yet frankly, it's difficult to find great literature that encourages rulers to invade foreign lands, to escalate when battles go badly, to scorn critics, to be cocksure of themselves in the face of adversity. The themes of the classics tend to be the opposite.Literature and history invariably counsel doubt and skepticism -- even when you think you see Desdemona's infidelity with your own eyes, you don't; even when your advisers are telling you ''it's a slam-dunk,'' it's not. The classics have an overwhelmingly cautionary bias, operating as a check on any impulsive rush to war.Perhaps that is because, as Foreign Policy argues in its most recent issue, humans have an ingrained psychological tilt to hawkishness. In many ways, the authors note, human decision-making tends to err in ways that magnify conflict and make it difficult to climb down from confrontation.My hunch is that the classics resonate in part because they are an antidote to that human frailty; literature has generated so many warnings about hubris in part to save us from ourselves.Eastern classics have that same purpose of trying to tame and restrain us. The central theme of Chinese philosophy is the need for moderation, and Sun Tzu's famous ''Art of War'' advises generals on how to win without fighting. (Sun Tzu and Julius Caesar alike also appreciated the diplomatic benefits of treating enemy prisoners well; they would be appalled by Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo.)So Mr. Bush should resolve that for every hour he spends with Mr. Cheney, he will spend another curled up with classical authors like Sophocles. ''Antigone,'' for example, tells of King Creon, a good man who wants the best for his people -- and yet ignores public opinion, refuses to admit error, goes double or nothing with his bets, and is slow to adapt to changing circumstance.Creon's son pleads with his father to be less rigid. The trees that bend survive the seasons, he notes, while those that are inflexible are blown over and destroyed.Americans today yearn for the same kind of wise leadership that the ancient Greeks did: someone with the wisdom to adjust course, to acknowledge error, to listen to critics, to show compassion as well as strength, to discern moral nuance as well as moral clarity. Alexander the Great used to sleep with the ''Iliad'' under his pillow; maybe Mr. Bush should try ''Antigone.''Oh, and for Mrs. Bush? How about Aristophanes' ''Lysistrata''?Op-Ed ColumnistAt the Republican National Convention in 2000 that nominated him for vice president, Dick Cheney told a rapturous crowd that Democrats ''will offer more lectures, and legalisms, and carefully worded denials. We offer another way, a better way, and a stiff dose of truth.''So, Mr. Cheney, now that the Scooter Libby trial is raising doubts about your own integrity, you owe the nation an explanation. Here are a few questions to help frame your explanation of your activities:Mr. Vice President, did you push Mr. Libby to dig into Joe Wilson's background and discredit him? Mr. Libby made such a major effort to gather materials from the C.I.A. and State Department about Mr. Wilson -- both before and after you told him on June 12, 2003, that his wife worked at the C.I.A. -- that it seems likely that you commanded the effort. True?What did you mean when you wrote, in a note to Scott McClellan that has been entered into evidence, ''not going to protect one staffer + sacrifice the guy the Pres. that was asked to stick his head in the meat grinder because of incompetence of others.''First, you wrote that it was ''the Pres.'' who had asked Mr. Libby to do this, and then you crossed out those two words. Did President Bush indeed ask that Mr. Libby take charge of the effort to discredit Ambassador Wilson? And is it true, as was hinted at in the trial, that the White House tried to block the release of this document?When you discussed Joe Wilson with Mr. Libby on Air Force Two on July 12, 2003, what instructions did you give him?Trial testimony indicates that on that flight, Mr. Libby looked over some questions a reporter had sent in about Mr. Wilson and then said: ''Let me go talk to the boss and I'll be back.'' After consulting with you, Mr. Libby later called reporters to feed them a skewed version of Mr. Wilson's trip.Mr. Cheney, on that plane, did you specifically tell Mr. Libby to leak to reporters the fact that Mr. Wilson's wife worked at the C.I.A.?Deborah Bond of the F.B.I. has testified that Mr. Libby acknowledged in one of his interviews that on that flight, he might have talked to you about whether to tell the news media about Valerie Wilson. So did he?Since Mr. Libby is renowned for his caution, it seems highly unlikely that he would have leaked classified information twice to reporters right after talking to you, unless you had sanctioned the leak.During the leak investigation, were you aware that Mr. Libby was telling the F.B.I. apparently false information?You rode to work with him nearly every day in your limousine, and the issue never came up? Or did you ask Mr. Libby to protect you because you didn't want it known that in fact you were the one who had told him about Ms. Wilson? Was there some other information you wanted kept secret?Were you trying to cover up your own reliance on misinformation about Iraqi W.M.D. by blaming the C.I.A. and anybody else within range, like Mr. Wilson?More than anybody, Mr. Vice President, you made the argument in the run-up to the war that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. And one senses, in the indictment and the trial testimony, that by the early summer of 2003, there was panic in your office that the W.M.D. had failed to materialize.So when Ambassador Wilson came forward, you seem to have been infuriated. You tried to blame the C.I.A., and then your office tried to discredit Mr. Wilson by arguing that he had simply enjoyed a junket arranged by his wife.Robert Grenier, a C.I.A. official, told the court that he thought the White House was ''trying to avoid responsibility for positions that they took with regard to the truth about whether or not Iraq had attempted to acquire uranium from Niger.'' So did this all arise from an attempted cover-up?So when are you going to come clean?When Richard Nixon was accused of misusing campaign contributions in 1952, he gave his famous Checkers speech. When questions rose about Spiro Agnew's conduct in 1973, he repeatedly addressed them in public. (Look, you know you're in trouble when the press tries to hold you to the same standards of transparency and integrity as Nixon and Agnew.)I'm not accusing you of committing a crime. But there are serious questions here, and you owe the nation not legalisms, but that ''stiff dose of truth.'' If you continue to stonewall, then you don't belong in office and you should resign.So is your Fidelity account underwriting genocide in Sudan? Is your pension fund helping finance the janjaweed militias that throw babies into bonfires in Darfur and Chad?The answer to both questions is complicated but may be yes, and that's one reason a divestment campaign is gaining strength around America and abroad. Six states (including California) have already begun divesting from companies active in Sudan, and legislation is pending in 23 more states, including New York.More than 30 universities, beginning with Harvard in 2005, have sold certain Sudan-related investments. Five cities have divested, and New York is considering doing so. A bill before Congress would bar certain companies active in Sudan from receiving federal contracts.Let's start by acknowledging that divestment and economic sanctions generally fail. The closest thing to a success was the way they helped topple white rule in South Africa in the 1980s, but even there one result was greater hardship for ordinary blacks.Elsewhere, divestment and economic sanctions have mostly been counterproductive. Our Cuban embargo has hurt Cubans but cemented Fidel Castro in power; our sanctions against Myanmar have inflicted tremendous pain on Burmese without dislodging the brutal government.So I'm against economic sanctions in almost every case. But Sudan is an exception, a rare instance where narrowly focused divestment makes practical as well as moral sense.Partly that's because Sudan's economy depends on foreign oil companies, giving the outside world leverage. And 70 percent of Sudan's oil revenue goes to weaponry, like bayonets used to gouge out people's eyes.The oil companies in Sudan aren't American; the biggest players are Chinese companies. Pressure on them is also one way to get the attention of the Chinese government, which is Sudan's main protector in the U.N. Security Council.So in this case pressure on a small number of foreign companies could help get Sudan's attention, and that of its protectors in China, without hurting ordinary people. And Sudan has shown that it can be nudged and embarrassed into behaving better: the best example is the way that pressure (including economic sanctions) led Sudan's leaders to end their brutal war in southern Sudan in 2005.Fortunately, the Darfur divestment campaign has been remarkably restrained in choosing targets. Organizers are not seeking divestment from all of the more than 400 foreign companies that operate in Sudan, but only from a few dozen that are complicit in genocide without helping ordinary Sudanese. (See the guidelines at www.SudanDivestment.org, developed largely by a recent U.C.L.A. graduate, Adam Sterling.)''People are surprised to find out that Royal Dutch Shell is not a targeted company by us, even though they are an oil firm and operate in Sudan,'' notes Mark Hanis, who runs the Genocide Intervention Network (which has a divestment hot line, 1-800-GENOCIDE). That's because Shell sells gas in Sudan at a retail level, rather than enriching the army through production, Mr. Hanis said, and less than 5 percent of those sales are believed to be to the government.More than other money managers, Fidelity has resisted the pressure and clung firmly to Sudan-related investments. So Darfur campaigners are urging investors to avoid Fidelity mutual funds: more information is at www.FidelityOutofSudan.com.The biggest U.S. investor in Class H shares of PetroChina, a Chinese oil concern whose parent company is active in Sudan, is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. I have huge respect for Mr. Buffett, and he may be thinking: My obligation is to make money for shareholders, not to use their investments in a dubious attempt to save the world. But surely if Berkshire Hathaway and Fidelity mutual funds saw lucrative opportunities in selling bayonets to the janjaweed, they would balk at that. We do have limits; the question is where we draw them.In this case, the cost of divestment to fund managers or investors is negligible, and there is a real prospect that the strategy will add enough attention, embarrassment and pressure that Sudan will stop slaughtering Darfuris -- just as it has stopped massacring people in southern Sudan.It's not a sure thing. But remember that in Darfur and Chad, aid workers -- some of them Americans -- are being killed, raped and beaten as they try to alleviate the slaughter. So shouldn't we make the minimal sacrifice of divestment, rather than blithely continue to invest in ways that provide grenades and guns to kill aid workers and Darfuris alike?Op-Ed ColumnistFor those like myself who oppose the ''surge'' in Iraq and seek a timetable for withdrawal, the hard question is: what happens if all hell breaks loose?What happens if the removal of U.S. troops leads to large-scale massacres, to a regional war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, to Kurdish-Arab-Turkmen fighting in Kirkuk, to a Turkish invasion of Kurdistan? Conservatives have a right to ask: why advocate a withdrawal that could lead to genocide in Iraq?The first part of a response is to doubt President Bush's premise that a buildup is necessarily the best way to avoid a cataclysm. Iraqis themselves don't think so. On the contrary, one poll last fall found that 78 percent of Iraqis believed that American troops provoked more violence than they prevented.Another poll, conducted by the State Department and reported by The Washington Post, found that nearly three-quarters of Baghdad residents would feel safer if American forces left Iraq. So if our aim is to avoid catastrophic bloodshed in Iraq, it may well be that we're more likely to accomplish that by leaving rather than staying.A second point is that the bloodshed can end only after Shiite leaders make political concessions to Sunnis, and our presence may be impeding that kind of political settlement. Once we set a deadline for departure, the Shiite leaders will look into the abyss -- the prospect of Iraq, on their watch, splintering forever -- and that may encourage moves toward a political settlement.In any case, it doesn't work when we want to stay in Iraq more than the Iraqis want us there.Not only do polls show that Iraqis overwhelmingly want U.S. troops gone within a year, but Iraqi leaders themselves are cool to Mr. Bush's surge. ''The problem is not more troops or less troops,'' the Iraqi vice president, Adil Abdul Mahdi, told me over lunch last month in Davos.We shouldn't send our troops into harm's way unless Iraqis are pleading for them. If we're the ones begging for the opportunity to shed blood in Baghdad, it's time to come home.There are a few other steps we can take to reduce the chance of large-scale massacres. David Scheffer, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes issues, suggests putting the Iraqi government on an ''atrocity watch'': warning Iraqi leaders that they can be prosecuted if Shiite militias and the Iraqi police slaughter Sunnis with impunity. All this might lead Iraq's leaders to restrain their militias.Then there's diplomacy: we have to get the help of Iraq's neighbors, especially Iran, to pursue our common interest in a stable Iraq (just as we had Iran's cooperation five years ago in overthrowing the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan).Instead we are going down a path of escalation. Two of the Iranian officials arrested by the U.S. recently were actually in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to try to bring stability, Mr. Mahdi told me.I've been asking experts what they think the odds are that the U.S. will strike Iranian nuclear sites in Mr. Bush's remaining two years in office. A common answer is about a 30 percent chance (plus maybe a 20 percent chance that Israel will strike). If that happened, Iran would make our troops pay a horrendous price in Iraq and Afghanistan alike.Speaking of Afghanistan, a thoughtful new report from the Council on Foreign Relations notes that Iraq is siphoning off so many resources that we could end up failing in Afghanistan as well. The report warns that Iraq is all-consuming and makes it difficult for the U.S. to address other priorities.''U.S. interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region can be more effectively advanced if the United States disengages from Iraq,'' the report declares. ''Indeed, the sooner Washington grasps this nettle, the sooner it can begin to repair the damage that has been done to America's international position. Staying longer means more damage and a later start on repair.''So at the end of the day, genocide is possible in Iraq, but there's no crystal ball to tell anyone what will happen if we stay or go. Keeping troops in Iraq has steadily increased the risk of a bloodbath. The best way to reduce that risk is, I think, to announce a timetable for withdrawal and to begin a different kind of surge: of diplomacy.A majority of Iraqis may well be right in thinking that we are part of the problem rather than the solution -- and maybe a phased withdrawal will nudge Iraqis back from the brink and make a cataclysm less likely.Op-Ed ColumnistPresidents are supposed to be strong, and on his latest visit to Africa Jimmy Carter proved himself strong enough to weep.The first stop of Mr. Carter's four-nation African trip was Ghana, where he visited his projects to wipe out the Guinea worm, a horrendous two-foot-long parasite that lives inside the body and finally pops out, causing excruciating pain.Mr. Carter was shaken by the victims he met, including a 57-year-old woman with a Guinea worm coming out of her nipple.''She and her medical attendants said she had another coming out her genitals between her legs, and one each coming out of both feet,'' Mr. Carter added. ''And so she had four Guinea worms emerging simultaneously.''''Little 3-, 4- and 5-year-old children were screaming uncontrollably with pain'' because of the worms emerging from their flesh, Mr. Carter said. ''I cried, along with the children.''We tend to think of human rights in terms of a right to vote, a right to free speech, a right to assembly. But a child should also have a right not to suffer agony because of a worm that is easily preventable, as well as a right not to go blind because of a lack of medication that costs a dollar or two, even a right not to die for lack of a $5 mosquito net.As president, Mr. Carter put the issue of human rights squarely on the national agenda. Now Mr. Carter argues -- and he's dead right -- that we conceive of human rights too narrowly as political and civil rights, and that we also need to fight for the human right of children to live healthy lives.He has led the way in waging that battle. Because of Mr. Carter's two-decade battle against Guinea worm disease, it is expected to be eradicated worldwide within the next five years. It will be the first ailment to be eliminated since smallpox in 1977, and it has become a race between the worm and the ex-president to see who outlasts the other.''I'm determined to live long enough to see no cases of Guinea worm anywhere in the world,'' Mr. Carter said as he walked in blue jeans through a couple of villages in a remote corner of southwestern Ethiopia, the third country of his African tour.After leaving the White House, Mr. Carter ended up ''adopting'' diseases like Guinea worm disease, river blindness, elephantiasis, trachoma and schistosomiasis that afflict the world's most voiceless people. These are horrific diseases that cause unimaginable suffering, yet they rarely get attention, treatment or research funding because their victims are impoverished and invisible.When Mr. Carter met with Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, then Pakistan's president, President Zia had never heard of Guinea worm and didn't know it existed in Pakistan. Nor did his health minister. But after Mr. Carter put the issue on the agenda, Pakistan worked energetically with the Carter Center to eliminate the parasite in that country.The villages here in Ethiopia that Mr. Carter visited cradle a fast-moving creek, making a lovely image of thatch huts and bubbling water. But the creek is home to the black flies whose bites spread the parasite that causes river blindness, leading to unbearable itching and often eventually to blindness.''It's almost impossible to imagine the suffering of people with river blindness,'' Mr. Carter said as he traipsed through the village beside his wife, Rosalynn.Already, Mr. Carter's campaign is making huge progress against the disease.Kemeru Befita, a woman washing her clothes in the creek near Mr. Carter, told me that two of her children had caught river blindness in the last couple of months. After a visit to the witch doctor didn't help, she took them to a clinic where -- thanks to Mr. Carter's program -- they received medicine that killed the baby worms. They are two of the nearly 10 million people to whom the Carter Center gave medication last year alone, who won't go blind.At the end of the day, this one-term president who left office a pariah in his own party will transform the lives of more people in more places over a longer period of time than any other recent president. And I hope that he can also transform our conception of human rights, so that we show an interest not only in the human rights of people suffering from the oppression of dictators, but also from the even more brutal tyranny of blindness, malaria and worms.Op-Ed ColumnistThey were two old men, one arriving by motorcade with bodyguards and the other groping blindly as he shuffled on a footpath with a stick, but for a moment the orbits of Jimmy Carter and Mekonnen Leka intersected on this remote battlefield in southern Ethiopia.Mr. Mekonnen, who thinks he may be 78, is a patient in Mr. Carter's war on river blindness. He is so blind that he rarely leaves the house any more, but on this occasion he staggered to the village clinic to get a treatment for the worms inside him.His skin is mottled because the worms cause ferocious itching, especially when they become more active at night. He and other victims scratch until they are bloodied and their skin is partly worn away. Ultimately the worms travel to the eye, where they often destroy the victim's sight.Ethiopia has the largest proportion of blind people in the world, 1.2 percent, because of the combined effects of river blindness and trachoma. As in many African countries, the wrenching emblem of poverty is a tiny child leading a blind beggar by a stick.As Mr. Mekonnen waited on a bench by the clinic, there was a flurry of activity, and an Ethiopian announced in the Amharic language that ''a great elder'' had arrived. Then Mr. Mekonnen heard voices speaking a foreign language and a clicking of cameras, and finally the whirlwind around Mr. Carter moved on.''Do you know who that was?'' I asked Mr. Mekonnen.''I couldn't see,'' he replied.''Have you ever heard of Jimmy Carter?''Yet in remote places like this, former President Carter, at 82, is leading a private war on disease that should inspire and shame President Bush and other world leaders into joining. It's not just that Mr. Carter's wars have been more successful than Mr. Bush's; Mr. Carter is also rehabilitating the image of the U.S. abroad and transforming the lives of the world's most wretched peoples. (For a video of Mr. Carter's trip, please go to www.nytimes.com/ontheground.)On the previous night, Mr. Mekonnen had slept under a mosquito net for the first time in his life, as part of a Carter initiative to wipe out malaria and elephantiasis in this region. And Mr. Mekonnen now uses an outhouse as a result of a Carter Center initiative to build 350,000 outhouses in rural Ethiopia to defeat blindness from trachoma.Mr. Carter has almost managed to wipe out one horrific ailment -- Guinea worm -- and is making great strides against others, including river blindness and elephantiasis. In this area, people are taking an annual dose of a medicine called Mectizan -- donated by Merck, which deserves huge credit -- that prevents itching and blindness.Mectizan also gets rid of intestinal worms, leaving Ethiopian villagers stronger and more able to work or attend school. Among adults, the deworming revives sex drive, so some people have named their children Mectizan.Mr. Carter's private campaign against the diseases of poverty, put together with pennies and duct tape, is a model of what our government could do. Imagine if the U.S. resolved that it would wipe out malaria and elephantiasis (both are spread by mosquitoes, so a combined campaign makes sense). What if we celebrated science not by trying to go to Mars but by extinguishing malaria? What if we tried to burnish America's image abroad not only with press releases and propaganda broadcasts, but also with a bold campaign against disease?So I wish that President Bush could visit villages like this and see what Mr. Carter has accomplished as a private individual. Mr. Bush, to his great credit, has financed a major campaign against AIDS that will save nine million lives, and he is also increasing spending against malaria -- but not nearly as energetically as he is increasing the number of troops in Iraq. So I asked Mr. Carter whether President Bush should be pushing not for a possible war with Iran, but for a war on malaria.''That would certainly be my preference,'' he said. ''I thought the war in Iraq was one of the worst mistakes our country ever made, and we're possibly about to make an even worse mistake by precipitating a war with Iran. But I would like to see us shift away from war being a high priority, to diplomacy and benevolent causes.''So, President Bush, how about if we as a nation join Mr. Carter's war on diseases that afflict the world's poorest peoples -- and are one reason they are so poor. That's a war that would unite Americans, not divide them. Come on, Mr. Bush, sound the trumpets!Op-Ed ColumnistPresident Bush's budget request this month proposes that the U.S. cut spending on global maternal and child health programs to $346 million, or just $1.15 per person in the U.S.To understand what the cuts mean, meet Simeesh Segaye.Ms. Simeesh, a warm 21-year-old Ethiopian peasant with a radiant smile, married at 19 and quickly became pregnant. After she had endured two days of obstructed labor, her neighbors carried her to a road and packed her into a bus, but it took another two days to get to the nearest hospital.By then the baby was dead. And Ms. Simeesh awakened to another horror: She began leaking urine and feces from her vagina, a result of a childbirth injury called obstetric fistula.Ms. Simeesh's family paid $10 for a public bus to take her to a hospital that could repair her fistula. But the other passengers took one whiff of her and complained vociferously that they shouldn't have to share the vehicle with someone who stinks. The bus driver ordered her off.Mortified, Ms. Simeesh was crushed again when her husband left her. Her parents built a separate hut for her because of her smell, but they nursed her and brought her food and water.In that hut, she stayed -- alone, ashamed, helpless, bewildered. She barely ate, because the more she ate or drank, the more wastes trickled down her legs.''I just curled up,'' she said. ''For two years.''Ms. Simeesh was, in a sense, lucky. She wasn't one of the 530,000 women who die each year in pregnancy and childbirth -- a number that hasn't declined in 30 years. Here in Ethiopia, a woman has one chance in 14 of dying in childbirth at some point in her life.For every woman who dies in childbirth worldwide, another 20 are injured. But because the victims are born with three strikes against them -- they are poor, rural and female -- they are invisible and voiceless, receiving almost no help either from poor countries or from the developed world.So Ms. Simeesh huddled in a fetal position on the floor of her hut for two years, thinking about killing herself. Finally, last month, Ms. Simeesh's parents sold all their farm animals and paid a driver to take her to the hospital in a vehicle with no other passengers present to complain.So now Ms. Simeesh is lying in a bed here in the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital (www.fistulafoundation.org). The hospital is run by an Australian gynecologist, Dr. Catherine Hamlin, whom I've written about before. Dr. Hamlin is the Mother Teresa of our age.The doctors here will try to repair the fistula, but first they must strengthen Ms. Simeesh, who is skeletal. Her legs have withered and are permanently bent into a fetal position, so that she can't straighten them or move them.In the U.S., neither Democrats nor Republicans have ever shown great interest in maternal health. But it's an issue that deserves far more support, partly because we know exactly what to do to bring down maternal mortality and morbidity: Sri Lanka and Honduras have both shown how poor countries can drastically cut rates of death and injury.And in the breakaway Somaliland region of Somalia, an extraordinary woman named Edna Adan Ismail runs her own obstetric hospital and trains midwives, underscoring how women's lives can be saved even in the most difficult environments. Ms. Edna struggles one moment to deliver a breech baby, and the next to round up surgical masks. She is helped by a group of Americans, Friends of Edna Hospital (www.ednahospital.netfirms.com), who raise funds and scavenge supplies. (To see Ms. Edna, Ms. Simeesh and others in this column, please visit the video I have posted on my blog at www.nytimes.com/ontheground.)Dr. Hamlin and Ms. Edna deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for showing the world how to turn the tide of maternal mortality and morbidity, and for offering comfort to some of the most forlorn people in the world. At a time when we're proposing further cuts in our negligible budget for maternal and child health, I was deeply moved by the sight of Ruth Kennedy, a British midwife at the fistula hospital, comforting Ms. Simeesh and bringing a lovely smile to her lips.''They think they've been cursed by God,'' Ms. Kennedy explained. ''And we tell them that they haven't been cursed by God and that they're beautiful and that the only reason that they got a fistula is because we failed them as health professionals.''Op-Ed ColumnistHere's the ethos of Somalia, as a former Mogadishu resident explained it to me: ''If I use a dollar to buy food, then tomorrow I have nothing. If I use a dollar to buy a bullet, then I can eat every day.''That enterprising can-do spirit has turned most of Somalia into the poster child of a failed state, where you feel underdressed without an assault rifle. But wait! Here in the north of the carcass of Somalia is the breakaway would-be nation of Somaliland, and it is a remarkable success -- for a country that doesn't exist.The U.S. and other governments don't recognize Somaliland, so the people here get next to zero foreign aid. And when the ''country'' was formed in 1991, it had been mostly obliterated in a civil war and was a collection of ruins and land mines.Yet the clans and elders here formed their own government, held free elections and even established an international airline. Relying on free markets and a general exhaustion with violence, the people of Somaliland embraced tranquillity and democracy and searched for ways to make a buck.Walk down the streets of Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, and instead of gunmen you come across the thriving jewelry and financial market: scores of vendors, most of them women, are hawking millions of dollars worth of gold, precious stones and foreign currency out in the open air. (Don't try that at home!) Continue down the street, and you see that Hargeisa has police cars, DHL service, cable television, orthodontists, a multitude of Internet cafes and traffic jams (including the horses and camels). There are public schools and hospitals -- even a public library.This is a conservative Muslim country, yet it is generally pro-American and tolerant. In the last election, more women voted than men. Women's groups are fighting the traditional practice of genital mutilation, administered to 97 percent of girls here.The lesson of Somaliland is simple: the most important single determinant of a poor country's success is not how much aid it receives but how well it is run. If a country adheres to free markets and good political and economic governance, it will generate domestic and foreign investments that dwarf any amount of aid.As President Dahir Rayale Kahin told me: ''There is a proverb in our country: 'You can wash your body only with your own hand.' Outsiders can help, but the indigenous people must find a solution themselves.''One lesson is that Western countries should not only increase their financial aid but also their pressure for better governance. It's great to forgive debts, but not graft or antimarket policies.The U.S. Millennium Challenge aid program, which promotes good governance, is a useful step in that direction. So is Tony Blair's program to battle corruption in Africa.One useful kind of Western aid is simply support for civil-society groups that battle corruption. Here in Somaliland, the press is generally free, but the president recently tossed three journalists in prison for reporting on corruption in his family. If Western countries speak out strongly in their defense, that effort may be worth a few million dollars in aid by reducing corruption in the future.More peer pressure from within Africa would also help. Other African countries should stand up to a racist like Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe with the same vigor they once used to stand up to white racist governments.Another essential kind of foreign aid is supporting market-friendly economic policies, especially those that would nurture manufacturing industries.In Mauritania, whose location in northwestern Africa would be ideal for exporting clothing to Europe and America, it takes 82 days to start a new business, which would then have to make 61 tax payments each year, requiring 696 hours to calculate and pay. And in the end, the tax would amount to 104.3 percent of the profit, according to the World Bank.All that explains why you don't have any shirts in your closet labeled ''Made in Mauritania.''So let's be more generous with foreign aid, giving more than 22 cents per $100 of national income to development assistance (the average for rich countries is 47 cents). But those of us who call for aid and debt forgiveness also need to push just as hard for recipient nations to improve their governance, for ultimately the best way for poor countries to prosper is to adopt pro-growth policies.And in the meantime, it's time to recognize Somaliland as a nation. When a place does this well, we should hail it as a model, not shun it.Op-Ed ColumnistThe U.S. has built a little-known military base here that represents one of our best strategies to fight terrorism in the coming years: The aim is to build things rather than blow them up.This base in Africa, established in 2003, sits at the entrance to the Red Sea in the small Muslim country of Djibouti, next to Somalia. Security is as tight as the sun is hot, with lots of bomb shelters, but the most apparent threats are distinctly, well, African.''We've got two hyenas out there,'' said Cmdr. Darryl Centanni of the Navy, executive officer of Camp Lemonier, pointing to a jogging trail on which troops were running through the semidesert. ''So the running gets pretty interesting.''He added that a pack of wild dogs also speeds up joggers but that the dogs mostly get food by catching fish in the sea. (I'm not sure I trust military intelligence on that one.)After 9/11, the focus of America's response to terrorism has been mostly on using military force to destroy possible threats in places like Iraq and intimidate just about everyone. The ethos was borrowed from the ancient Romans: ''Oderint, dum metuant'' -- ''Let them hate, so long as they fear.''Yet all in all, that strategy has backfired catastrophically, particularly in Iraq, and turned us into Al Qaeda's best recruiter.So that's why the softer touch in Centcom's strategy here is so welcome. It aims to help bring stability to northeastern Africa and to address humanitarian needs -- knowing that humanitarian involvement will make us safer as well.''The U.S. started to realize that there's more to counterterrorism than capture-kill kinetics,'' said Capt. Patrick Myers of the Navy, director of plans and policy here. ''Our mission is 95 percent at least civil affairs.  It's trying to get at the root causes of why people want to take on the U.S.''One humanitarian mission for which the U.S. military is superbly prepared is responding to natural disasters. While the U.S. has spent vast sums broadcasting propaganda to the Muslim world, the two most successful efforts at winning good will both involved the military. One was the dispatch of soldiers to help Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami, and the other was the use of U.S. forces to help Pakistan after the Kashmir earthquake.The 1,800 troops here do serve a traditional military purpose, for the base was used to support operations against terrorists in Somalia recently and is available to reach Sudan, Yemen or other hot spots. But the forces here spend much of their time drilling wells or building hospitals; they rushed to respond when a building collapsed in Kenya and when a passenger ferry capsized in Djibouti.Rear Adm. James Hart, commander of the task force at Camp Lemonier, suggested that if people in nearby countries feel they have opportunities to improve their lives, then ''the chance of extremism being welcomed greatly, if not completely, diminishes.''The U.S. announced last month that it would form a new Africa Command, aimed partly at blocking the rise of ungoverned spaces that nurture terrorism. The new command offers tremendous humanitarian potential as well, for in some poor countries the most useful ''aid workers'' are the ones in camouflage carrying guns.In the Central African Republic in September I visited a town with a lovely new hospital built as a foreign aid project. But the hospital was an empty shell, gutted by militias rampaging through the area. In places like that, there's no point in building schools or clinics unless you also help with security.Some of the most successful aid projects in Africa have been the dispatch of armed peacekeepers to Mozambique and British troops to Sierra Leone. In both places, troops brought what the besieged population most desperately needed -- order -- and laid the groundwork for recovery. We should be far more aggressive about dispatching small numbers of troops to impose a no-fly zone over Darfur or to destroy Sudanese militias that invade Chad and the Central African Republic.We can also do far more to train armies in Africa. The deal we offer African presidents should be along these lines: You run a country cleanly and tolerate dissent, and we'll help ensure that no brutal rebel force comes out of the jungle to create chaos and overthrow you.Helping fragile countries with security is just as important as helping them with education and medical care. So let's hope that this new base in Africa is the start of a broad new policy that doesn't aim to make us hated or feared, but respected.Op-Ed ColumnistThe conventional wisdom about Barack Obama is that he's smart and charismatic but so inexperienced that we should feel jittery about him in the Oval Office.But that view is myopic. In some respects, Mr. Obama is far more experienced than other presidential candidates.His experience as an antipoverty organizer in Chicago, for example, gives him a deep grasp of a crucial 21st-century challenge -- poverty in America -- that almost all politicians lack. He says that grass-roots experience helps explain why he favors not only government spending programs, like early childhood education, but also cultural initiatives, like efforts to promote responsible fatherhood.In foreign policy as well, Mr. Obama would bring to the White House an important experience that most other candidates lack: he has actually lived abroad. He spent four years as a child in Indonesia and attended schools in the Indonesian language, which he still speaks.''I was a little Jakarta street kid,'' he said in a wide-ranging interview in his office (excerpts are on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground). He once got in trouble for making faces during Koran study classes in his elementary school, but a president is less likely to stereotype Muslims as fanatics -- and more likely to be aware of their nationalism -- if he once studied the Koran with them.Mr. Obama recalled the opening lines of the Arabic call to prayer, reciting them with a first-rate accent. In a remark that seemed delightfully uncalculated (it'll give Alabama voters heart attacks), Mr. Obama described the call to prayer as ''one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset.''Moreover, Mr. Obama's own grandfather in Kenya was a Muslim. Mr. Obama never met his grandfather and says he isn't sure if his grandfather's two wives were simultaneous or consecutive, or even if he was Sunni or Shiite. (O.K., maybe Mr. Obama should just give up on Alabama.)Our biggest mistake since World War II has been a lack of sensitivity to other people's nationalism, from Vietnam to Iraq. Perhaps as a result of his background, Mr. Obama has been unusually sensitive to such issues and to the need to project respect rather than arrogance. He has consistently shown great instincts.Mr. Obama's visit to Africa last year hit just the right diplomatic notes. In Kenya, he warmly greeted the president -- but denounced corruption and went out of his way to visit a bold newspaper that government agents had ransacked. In South Africa, he respectfully but firmly criticized the government's unscientific bungling of the AIDS epidemic. In Chad, he visited Darfur refugees.''My experience growing up in Indonesia or having family in small villages in Africa -- I think it makes me much more mindful of the importance of issues like personal security or freedom from corruption,'' he said, adding: ''I've witnessed it in much more direct ways than I think the average American has witnessed it.''As a senator, Mr. Obama has not only seized the issue of nuclear proliferation, but also the question of small arms. For a majority of the world's inhabitants, those AK-47s and R.P.G.'s are the weapons of mass destruction.So how would an Obama administration differ from the Bill Clinton presidency in foreign policy? One way, he said, would be a much greater emphasis on promoting education, health care and development in Africa and other poor regions -- not just for humanitarian reasons, but also with an eye to national security.''If we can't take what, relative to our military hardware and defense budgets, are a pittance, and put some resources into these areas, we will not be secure,'' he noted, adding: ''The Marshall Plan was part of a security strategy; it wasn't simply charity.''Mr. Obama thumps the White House on trade and foreign investments, like the Dubai ports deal -- but he isn't demagogic in the way that too many Democrats have been. And three years ago, Mr. Obama was quoted in The Chicago Tribune as making hawkish comments about a military strike on Iran, but in the interview he pirouetted and noted that one of the lessons of Iraq is that ''being trigger-happy  is a recipe for disaster.'' That's a welcome sign of growth.So, granted, Mr. Obama lacks the extensive experience at top levels of diplomacy of, say, Dick Cheney or  oh, never mind.What sets Mr. Obama apart is the way his training has been at the grass-roots rather than in the treetops. And that may be the richest kind of background of all, yielding not just experience, but also wisdom.Op-Ed ColumnistCast your eyes to the right and meet Hidaya Abatemam, whom I met last month in a remote area of southern Ethiopia. She is 6 years old and weighs 17 pounds.Hidaya was starved nearly to death and may well have suffered permanent mental impairment, helping to trap her -- and her own children, if she lives that long -- in another generation of poverty.Yet maybe the more interesting question is not why Hidaya is starving but why the world continues to allow 30,000 children like her to die each day of poverty.Ultimately what is killing girls like her isn't precisely malnutrition or malaria, but indifference. And that, in turn, arises from our insularity, our inexperience in traveling and living in poor countries, so that we have difficulty empathizing with people like Hidaya.I often hear comments from readers like: ''It's tragic over there, but we've got our own problems that we have to solve first.'' Nobody who has held the hand of a starving African child could be that dismissive.That lack of firsthand experience abroad also helps explain why we are so awful at foreign policy: we just don't ''get'' how our actions will be perceived abroad, so time and again -- in Vietnam, China, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Latin America -- we end up clumsily empowering our enemies.Part of the problem is that American universities do an execrable job preparing students for global citizenship. A majority of the world's population lives on less than $2 a day, but the vast majority of American students graduate without ever gaining any insight into how that global majority lives.According to a Roper/National Geographic poll, 38 percent of Americans aged 18 to 24 consider speaking another language to be ''not too important.'' Sixty-three percent of those young Americans can't find Iraq on a map of the Middle East. And 89 percent don't correspond regularly with anyone outside the U.S.A survey cited by the Modern Language Association found that only 9 percent of American college students enroll in a foreign language class.Let's face it: We're provincial.That's one reason that I always exhort college students to take a ''gap year'' and roam the world, or at least to take a summer or semester abroad -- and spend it not in Paris or London, but traveling through Chinese or African villages. Universities should give course credit for such experiences -- and offer extra credit for students who catch intestinal worms.So I'm now putting my company's money where my mouth is. On Tuesday, in partnership with MySpace.com, The New York Times and I will announce a second annual ''win a trip'' contest to choose a university student to travel with me on a reporting trip to Africa. And this year, in addition to a student, I'll choose a schoolteacher -- from a middle school or high school -- to accompany me as well.Last year I chose a young woman from Mississippi, Casey Parks, and we traveled together through central Africa. Casey and I saw malnourished children just like Hidaya, and visited burned-out villages in areas of the Central African Republic that had been caught up in the furies of the spreading Darfur genocide. Pygmy trackers led us through the jungle to see gorillas and elephants, and we managed to be held up at gunpoint by bandits.In Cameroon, we interviewed a doctor about maternal mortality -- and then found a woman named Prudence, a mother of three, dying in the next room. A dead fetus was decomposing inside her, setting off a raging infection, but the doctor didn't care about her. And so she died. You can know intellectually that half a million women die in pregnancy each year, but it's still shattering to see a woman die so unnecessarily in front of you.If you win the trip, you won't be practicing tourism, but journalism. You'll blog and prepare videos for the New York Times and MySpace Web sites. I'm betting that you'll be able to connect with young readers and viewers -- and galvanize them to care about these issues -- in a way that I can't.So please spread the word about the contest. Rules and applications will be posted Tuesday at www.nytimes.com/winatrip and at www.myspace.com/kristofontheground.And for those who apply but don't win, go anyway on your own. You'll learn more than you ever would from an equivalent period in the classroom. And you'll gain not only the occasional intestinal parasite but also an understanding of why we should fight to save children like Hidaya.Op-Ed ColumnistFor anyone who thinks that ''genocide'' is absolutely the rock-bottom possibility, keep an eye on Darfur.The area of crisis has already spread from an area the size of France to one the size of Western Europe, encompassing Chad and Central African Republic while threatening to reignite the separate war between north and south Sudan. And aid workers increasingly are finding themselves under attack, so that humanitarian access is now lower than at any time since 2004.Six weeks ago, I invited readers to send in their own suggestions for what we should do about Darfur, and the result was a deluge of proposals from all over the world.The common thread was a far more muscular approach. Several readers suggested that we should dispatch a private force -- supplied by a military contractor like Blackwater USA -- to fight the janjaweed militia.Many readers also recommended that we supply arms to Darfur refugees or rebel groups. Some people suggested that we blockade Port Sudan, through which Sudan exports oil.Many also wanted a much tougher approach toward China, which has protected Sudan diplomatically. Some advocated a boycott of all Chinese products, while others favor a boycott of the Beijing Olympics in 2008.After inviting the discussion, I feel ungrateful in criticizing such well-meaning suggestions -- but I'm afraid that in the aftermath of the Iraq war, aggressive military measures would be counterproductive. We would be handing President Omar al-Bashir a propaganda victory and a chance to rally support (''Those American crusaders are trying to steal another Arab country's oil!'').Likewise, Darfur is already awash with guns and irresponsible armed factions terrorizing civilians. The last thing Darfur needs is more AK-47s.As for China, a boycott would antagonize ordinary Chinese and cause Beijing to dig in its heels. But I like the idea of activists like Eric Reeves of organizing a ''Genocide Olympics'' campaign to shame Beijing into better behavior.Likewise, I approve of many suggestions that sought more television coverage of Darfur. The slacker now is ABC News. The Tyndall Report, which monitors network news coverage, found that ABC's nightly newscasts included just 11 minutes of coverage of Darfur in all of 2006, compared with the 23 minutes ABC devoted to the false confession to the killing of JonBenet Ramsey. If only a Darfuri would falsely confess to killing JonBenet, maybe ABC would cover genocideI've posted more reader suggestions on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground. But in general, what Darfur needs isn't a single dramatic solution but a collection of incremental steps that add to the pressure for a peace agreement there.President Bush could ratchet up the pressure by giving a prime-time speech on Darfur. He and Tony Blair could lead a summit on Darfur in Europe. He could invite leaders of China and Egypt to join him on a trip to a Darfur refugee camp in Chad.Mr. Bush is expected to announce soon a series of financial sanctions on Sudan (similar to those that have inflicted considerable pain on North Korea and Iran), and those are welcome. Enforcing a no-fly zone would also help add to the pressure.But the top priority for Darfur is something that few people talk about -- a negotiated peace agreement. Peacekeepers are desperately needed, but the only real hope for lasting security is a negotiated peace among all the tribes of Darfur. And that is conceivable: an attempt last April came close, but ultimately a flawed deal was reached that made the conflict worse.Human rights groups have laid out excellent proposals for a Darfur peace process, and they need a vigorous push. To get an agreement, Khartoum will have to make a few more concessions (such as naming a Darfuri vice president, uniting the Darfur provinces, verifying the disarming of janjaweed), and it will also have to allow rebels to meet to work out negotiating positions.Western countries should also pledge to help finance reconstruction and compensation schemes, as incentives to wary Darfuris to back a peace deal. So far the U.S. has spent $2.7 billion on Darfur, and it would be a bargain to invest several hundred million dollars in a peace. Otherwise, north central Africa may collapse completely into war and anarchy, costing us countless billions and resulting in several million deaths over the coming decade.Op-Ed ColumnistDemocrats are railing at just about everything President Bush does, with one prominent exception: Mr. Bush's crushing embrace of Israel.There is no serious political debate among either Democrats or Republicans about our policy toward Israelis and Palestinians. And that silence harms America, Middle East peace prospects and Israel itself.Within Israel, you hear vitriolic debates in politics and the news media about the use of force and the occupation of Palestinian territories. Yet no major American candidate is willing today to be half as critical of hard-line Israeli government policies as, say, Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper.Three years ago, Israel's minister of justice spoke publicly of photos of an elderly Palestinian woman beside the ruins of her home, after it had been destroyed by the Israeli army. He said that they reminded him of his own grandmother, who had been dispossessed by the Nazis. Can you imagine an American cabinet secretary ever saying such a thing?One reason for the void is that American politicians have learned to muzzle themselves. In the run-up to the 2004 Democratic primaries, Howard Dean said he favored an ''even-handed role'' for the U.S. -- and was blasted for being hostile to Israel. Likewise, Barack Obama has been scolded for daring to say: ''Nobody is suffering more than the Palestinian people.'' In contrast, Hillary Rodham Clinton has safely refused to show an inch of daylight between herself and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.A second reason may be that American politicians just don't get it. King Abdullah of Jordan spoke to Congress this month and observed: ''The wellspring of regional division, the source of resentment and frustration far beyond, is the denial of justice and peace in Palestine.'' Though widely criticized, King Abdullah was exactly right: from Morocco to Yemen to Sudan, the Palestinian cause arouses ordinary people in coffee shops more than almost anything else.You can argue that Arabs pursue a double standard, focusing on repression by Israelis while ignoring greater human rights violations by fellow Arabs. But the suffering in Palestinian territories, while not remotely at the scale of brutality in Sudan or Iraq, is still tragically real.B'Tselem, a respected Israeli human rights organization, reports that last year Palestinians killed 17 Israeli civilians (including one minor) and six Israeli soldiers. In the same period, B'Tselem said, Israeli forces killed 660 Palestinians, triple the number killed in 2005. Of the Palestinians killed in 2006, half were not taking part in hostilities at the time they were killed, and 141 were minors.For more than half a century, the U.S. was an honest broker in the Middle East. Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan were warmer to Israel and Dwight Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush a bit cooler, but all sought a balance. George W. Bush has abandoned that tradition of balance.Hard-line Israeli policies have profoundly harmed that country's long-term security by adding vulnerable settlements, radicalizing young Palestinians, empowering Hamas and Hezbollah, isolating Israel in the world and nurturing another generation of terrorists in Lebanon. The Israeli right's aggressive approach has only hurt Israeli security, just as President Bush's invasion of Iraq ended up harming U.S. interests.The best hope for Israel in the long run isn't a better fence or more weaponry; they can provide a measure of security in the short run but will be of little help if terrorists turn, as they eventually will if the present trajectory continues, to chemical, biological or radiological weapons. Ultimately, security for Israel will emerge only from a peace agreement with Palestinians. We even know what that peace deal will look like: the Geneva accord, reached in 2003 by private Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.M. J. Rosenberg of the Israel Policy Forum headlined a recent column, ''Pandering Not Required.'' He wisely called on American presidential candidates instead to prove their support for Israel by pledging: ''If I am elected president, I will do everything in my power to bring about negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians with the goal of achieving peace and security for Israel and a secure state for the Palestinians.''Last summer, after Hezbollah killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others, Prime Minister Olmert invaded Lebanon and thus transformed Hezbollah into a heroic force in much of the Arab world. President Bush would have been a much better friend to Israel if he had tried to rein in Mr. Olmert. So let's be better friends -- and stop biting our tongues.Op-Ed ColumnistIf an 18-year-old American soldier were caught slipping obscure military paperwork to Iranian spies, he would be arrested, pilloried in the news media and tossed into prison for years.But in fact there's an American who has provided services of incalculably greater value to Iran in recent years. So you have to wonder: Is Dick Cheney an Iranian mole?Consider that the Bush administration's first major military intervention was to overthrow Afghanistan's Taliban regime, Iran's bitter foe to the east. Then the administration toppled Iran's even worse enemy to the west, the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq.You really think that's just a coincidence? That of all 193 nations in the world, we just happen to topple the two neighboring regimes that Iran despises?Moreover, consider how our invasion of Iraq went down. The U.S. dismantled Iraq's army, broke the Baath Party and helped install a pro-Iranian government in Baghdad. If Iran's ayatollahs had written the script, they couldn't have done better -- so maybe they did write the scriptWe fought Iraq, and Iran won. And that's just another coincidence?Or think about broader Bush administration policies in the Middle East. For six years, the White House vigorously backed Israeli hard-liners and refused to engage seriously in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, thus nurturing anti-Americanism and religious fundamentalism. Then last summer, the White House backed Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which turned Iran's proxies in Hezbollah into street heroes in much of the Arab world.Consider also the way the administration has systematically antagonized our former allies in Europe and Asia, undermining chances of a united front to block Iranian development of nuclear weapons. Mr. Cheney may nominally push for sanctions against Iran, but by alienating our allies he makes strong sanctions harder to achieve.And by condoning torture and extralegal detentions in Guantánamo, the White House antagonized Muslims around the world and made us look like hypocrites when we criticize Arab or Iranian human rights abuses. Take Mr. Cheney's endorsement of the torture known as waterboarding, which simulates drowning: ''It's a no-brainer for me,'' he said. The torturers in Iran's Evin prison must have cheered. They got a pass as well.Even at home, Iran's leaders have been bolstered by President Bush and Mr. Cheney. Iran's hard-liners are hugely unpopular and the regime is wobbly, but Bush administration policies have inflamed Iranian nationalism and given cover to the hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Why focus on Dick Cheney rather than his boss? Partly because Mr. Cheney, even more than Mr. Bush, has systematically pushed an extreme agenda that has transparently served Iranian purposes. And domestically, his role in the Scooter Libby scandal -- and his disgraceful refusal to explain just what he was doing at the crime scene -- ended up paralyzing executive decision-making and humiliating our government.Is that really just one more coincidence? Or could it be another case of Mr. Cheney's following instructions from his Iranian bosses to damage America?O.K., O.K. Of course, all this is absurd. Mr. Cheney isn't an Iranian mole. Nor is he a North Korean mole, though his we-don't-negotiate-with-evil policy toward North Korea has resulted in that country's quadrupling its nuclear arsenal. It's also unlikely that he is an Al Qaeda mole, even though Al Qaeda now has an important new base of support in Iraq.Like Kennedy and Johnson wading into Vietnam, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney harmed American interests not out of malice but out of ineptitude. I concede that they honestly wanted the best for America, but we still ended up getting the worst.So what are the lessons from this episode?Our national interests are as vulnerable to incompetence as to malicious damage. So we must identify and abandon the policies that backfired so catastrophically. The common threads of those damaging policies are clear: a refusal to negotiate with ''evil''; an aggressive willingness to use military force to solve problems; contempt for our allies; and the bending of legal and moral principles to allow indefinite detention and even torture, particularly for anyone with olive skin and a Muslim name.Whenever we've suspected a mole in our midst, we've gone to extreme lengths to find the traitor. This time, betrayed not by a mole but by failed policies, let's be just as resolute. It's time to uproot policies that in the last half-dozen years have damaged American interests incomparably more than any mole or foreign spy ever has in the last 200 years.Op-Ed ColumnistGen. Pervez Musharraf is facing angry street demonstrations around the country in the most serious crisis of his presidency -- and that's partly because he picked a fight with a middle-class housewife who is proving tougher and shrewder than he is.This drama is playing out in extraordinary scenes on Pakistani streets: crowds of roly-poly lawyers in dark suits braving clouds of tear gas to demand that Mr. Musharraf resign -- or even be tried for treason. It's impossible to know whether the protests will lead to a democratic revolution that topples Mr. Musharraf, to a military crackdown, or to a political deal that causes the protests to fizzle.And behind it all is the saga of the general and the housewife.''The nation is ready to rise up; there is a revolution behind me,'' says Amina Masood Janjua, a mother of three who has emerged as a nemesis of General Musharraf. Mrs. Janjua says she was a ''very timid person,'' uninvolved in politics and content to be ''queen of my house.'' But then two years ago, her husband disappeared, presumably kidnapped by government security agents.The government has regularly ''disappeared'' people it doesn't like, apparently keeping them in secret detention centers to be tortured and interrogated for months or years. Human rights groups count at least 400 such disappearances since 2002, when Mr. Musharraf began using the war on terror as cover to eliminate troublesome nationalists, religious activists and human rights organizers.Mrs. Janjua's husband, Masood Janjua, may have been picked up because of ties to a Muslim organization, but there is no indication he had broken any law. Mrs. Janjua says her family received a phone call from Mr. Musharraf's military secretary last year promising that her husband would be freed soon. But nothing happened, and officially the government knows nothing of his whereabouts.Terrified that her husband was being tortured, Mrs. Janjua began organizing other family members of the disappeared. They held a public demonstration -- but the police attacked the group and beat and publicly stripped Mrs. Janjua's 17-year-old son. As the police dragged him off, Mrs. Janjua's 11-year-old daughter screamed: ''You've taken my father; don't take my brother!'' He was freed that evening. The aim of the assault presumably was to warn Mrs. Janjua to be quiet -- just as relatives of other missing people have been warned that their loved ones will be harmed if they protest or speak to the press.One of the missing is Safdar Sarki, a Pakistani-American doctor and American citizen seized a year ago while campaigning for the rights of people in Sindh Province.''I was crying today; I was thinking of him,'' his wife, Rukhsana, said by phone from California. Her voice breaking, she promised that if Pakistan would just release her husband, she would make him stop fighting for human rights. She added: ''My sons are asking every day, 'Where is Papa? Where is Papa? ' ''Likewise: Where is the U.S.? The Bush administration has stuck more solidly with Mr. Musharraf (''a solid friend'' is the current State Department formulation) than with its principles. President Bush needs to make clear that the U.S. sides with Pakistan's democratic future, not its autocratic past.That future is being shaped by Mrs. Janjua, who sued the government over the disappearances. To everyone's astonishment, the Pakistani Supreme Court took up the case and ordered the government to account for those who are missing.Perhaps partly as a result -- and also to prevent the Supreme Court from complicating his election-fixing plans -- Mr. Musharraf this month suspended the chief justice of the Supreme Court. That's what has set off nationwide outrage and protests.Ordinary Pakistanis seem increasingly fed up with the president's lies and thuggery. Mr. Musharraf's contributions to Pakistan are enormous -- he rescued Pakistan's economy, fostered 7 percent growth rates, promoted education and nurtured an expanding middle class. But those same accomplishments are now raising aspirations for genuine democracy rather than the sham he offers.The risk is that a replacement would be worse: Pakistan has been one of the world's worst-ruled nations over the last 50 years, and Mr. Musharraf is better than his predecessors. But if the Pakistani public demands better government, that is ultimately a bullish sign for Pakistan and a useful warning to other autocrats.And maybe the movement will bring Mrs. Janjua and Mrs. Sarki their husbands home again.Op-Ed ColumnistFor those readers who ask me what they can do to help fight poverty, one option is to sit down at your computer and become a microfinancier.That's what I did recently. From my laptop in New York, I lent $25 each to the owner of a TV repair shop in Afghanistan, a baker in Afghanistan, and a single mother running a clothing shop in the Dominican Republic. I did this through www.kiva.org, a Web site that provides information about entrepreneurs in poor countries -- their photos, loan proposals and credit history -- and allows people to make direct loans to them.So on my arrival here in Afghanistan, I visited my new business partners to see how they were doing.On a muddy street in Kabul, Abdul Satar, a bushy-bearded man of 64, was sitting in the window of his bakery selling loaves for 12 cents each. He was astonished when I introduced myself as his banker, but he allowed me to analyze his business plan by sampling his bread: It was delicious.Mr. Abdul Satar had borrowed a total of $425 from a variety of lenders on Kiva.org, who besides me included Nathan in San Francisco, David in Rochester, N.Y., Sarah in Waltham, Mass., Nate in Fort Collins, Colo.; Cindy in Houston, and ''Emily's family'' in Santa Barbara, Calif.With the loan, Mr. Abdul Satar opened a second bakery nearby, with four employees, and he now benefits from economies of scale when he buys flour and firewood for his oven. ''If you come back in 10 years, maybe I will have six more bakeries,'' he said.Mr. Abdul Satar said he didn't know what the Internet was, and he had certainly never been online. But Kiva works with a local lender affiliated with Mercy Corps, and that group finds borrowers and vets them.The local group, Ariana Financial Services, has only Afghan employees and is run by Storai Sadat, a dynamic young woman who was in her second year of medical school when the Taliban came to power and ended education for women. She ended up working for Mercy Corps and becoming a first-rate financier; some day she may take over Citigroup.''Being a finance person is better than being a doctor,'' Ms. Sadat said. ''You can cure the whole family, not just one person. And it's good medicine -- you can see them get better day by day.''Small loans to entrepreneurs are now widely recognized as an important tool against poverty. Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his pioneering work with microfinance in Bangladesh.In poor countries, commercial money lenders routinely charge interest rates of several hundred percent per year. Thus people tend to borrow for health emergencies rather than to finance a new business. And partly because poor people tend to have no access to banks, they also often can't save money securely.Microfinance institutions typically focusing on lending to women, to give them more status and more opportunities. Ms. Sadat's group does lend mostly to women, but it's been difficult to connect some female borrowers with donors on Kiva -- because many Afghans would be horrified at the thought of taking a woman's photograph, let alone posting on the Internet.My other partner in Kabul is Abdul Saboor, who runs a small TV repair business. He used the loan to open a second shop, employing two people, and to increase his inventory of spare parts. ''I used to have to go to the market every day to buy parts,'' he said, adding that it was a two-and-a-half-hour round trip. ''Now I go once every two weeks.''Web sites like Kiva are useful partly because they connect the donor directly to the beneficiary, without going through a bureaucratic and expensive layer of aid groups in between. Another terrific Web site in this area is www.globalgiving.com, which connects donors to would-be recipients. The main difference is that GlobalGiving is for donations, while Kiva is for loans.A young American couple, Matthew and Jessica Flannery, founded Kiva after they worked in Africa and realized that a major impediment to economic development was the unavailability of credit at any reasonable cost.''I believe the real solutions to poverty alleviation hinge on bringing capitalism and business to areas where there wasn't business or where it wasn't efficient,'' Mr. Flannery said. He added: ''This doesn't have to be charity. You can partner with someone who's halfway around the world.''Op-Ed ColumnistThe Taliban is on the resurgence, again ruling a swath of southern Afghanistan, and President Hamid Karzai is sure of the reason: Pakistan.In an interview in his office, Mr. Karzai was scathing in his accusations of official Pakistani duplicity. For starters, he accused the Pakistani intelligence agencies of sheltering Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, in the Pakistani city of Quetta.''We have solid, clear information indicating that,'' he said. ''And I'm sorry I cannot be silent about this. As much as our friends in Pakistan may not like my saying that.''Mr. Karzai suggested that the Pakistani government wants the Afghan government to fail, so that it can use the Taliban to turn Afghanistan into a colony of Pakistan. Speaking in English, he said: ''The point that we are trying to tell the world [is] that the Taliban was a name, that there was another power behind -- a very criminally intended colonial thinking behind the Taliban movement.''One of the central mistakes of the last few years, Mr. Karzai suggested, was that the West had tried to battle the Taliban in Afghan villages instead of focusing on preventing Pakistan from financing and sheltering the Taliban. He put it this way: ''Rather than concentrating on the sources of terror, on the financiers of terror, on the trainers of terror and on the sanctuaries of terror, [we concentrated] rather heavily on going about in Afghan villages, where there was no terrorism, where there was the result of terrorism, yes, but not the roots of it, not the springboard of it.''Last September, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan reached a deal with tribal leaders on the Pakistani side of the border and pulled troops from the area. Since then, Mr. Karzai said, terrorism had surged.''We have almost daily reports of suicide bombers coming from there,'' he said, adding: ''If we had better cooperation from Pakistan, a great many of these cross-border crossings would stop.''Mr. Karzai also suggested that extreme Taliban policies -- like whipping ''immodest'' women -- were part of a Pakistani scheme to destroy Afghan morale and render Afghanistan a helpless puppet of Pakistan.These charges were so serious that at the end of the interview I double-checked with him. ''I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying,'' I told him. ''You're basically saying that the Taliban was using these policies because it was part of a Pakistani colonial policy to break the will of Afghanistan. And that still is, in effect, what is going on with Pakistan's policy.''''Absolutely,'' the president said. ''Absolutely.'' (I've posted a transcript and audio file of the interview on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground.)My own take, after reporting on both sides of the border, is that President Musharraf today is indeed turning a blind eye to the Taliban and aims to control it rather than wipe it out. But Mr. Karzai exaggerates the degree to which Pakistan is pulling the strings of Taliban puppets -- and overstates Mr. Musharraf's ability to destroy the Taliban.Moreover, there is plenty of blame to assign to the American and Afghan sides as well. We haven't done nearly enough to build up the Afghan Army and police, which don't antagonize conservative Afghans the way U.S. troops often do. We fumbled the reconstruction and aid projects needed to win hearts and minds. My vote is for a big push to battle maternal mortality, because 18,000 Afghan women die annually in childbirth -- dwarfing the 4,000 Afghans who died last year in Taliban-related violence.In addition, the Afghan government desperately needs to curb the mind-boggling corruption and narcotics trafficking by its own officials. In short, Pakistan is only one reason that southern Afghanistan is a catastrophe -- but a catastrophe it is.''Nowadays in Helmand Province, the Taliban is winning,'' said Haji Mir Wali, a member of Parliament from the southern province of Helmand. ''Ninety percent of the area is under the control of the Taliban, and they are imposing their strict rule again.''Outside of the provincial capital, he said, shops in Helmand don't dare sell music, men who trim their beards are threatened with death, and schools have closed for boys as well as girls. ''It's worse now than it was in the Taliban's time.'' he said.Unless we hear the fire bell in the night from the Afghan south, we could end up losing not only the war in Iraq but also the war in Afghanistan we should have won five years ago.David Brooks is on vacation.Op-Ed ColumnistIf the thought has ever flitted through your mind that your spouse isn't 100 percent perfect, then just contemplate what Shakira Parveen is going through. And give your own husband or wife a hug.When Ghulam Fareed proposed marriage to Ms. Parveen, he fingered prayer beads and seemed gentle and pious. Ms. Parveen didn't know him well, but she and her family were impressed.''The first month of marriage was O.K.,'' Ms. Parveen recalled. ''And then he said, you have to do whatever I tell you. If I tell you to sleep with other men, you have to do that.''It turned out that Mr. Fareed was running a brothel and selling drugs, and he intended Ms. Parveen to be his newest prostitute. ''I said, 'No, I don't want to sleep with other men,' '' she said, but he beat her unconscious with sticks, broke her bones and at one point set fire to her clothes. Finally, she broke and assented.Her ''husband'' locked her up in one room, she said, and the only people she saw were customers. ''For two years, I never left the house,'' she said.This kind of neo-slavery is the plight of millions of girls and young women (and smaller numbers of boys) around the world, particularly in Asia. A major difference from 19th-century slavery is that these victims are dead of AIDS by their 20s.Finally, Ms. Parveen was able to escape and return to her family, but Mr. Fareed was furious and began to torment her family, saying he would let up only if she returned to the brothel as his prostitute. Then Mr. Fareed's gang pressured Ms. Parveen by kidnapping her younger brother, Uzman, who was in the fifth grade. Uzman says that his hands and feet were shackled, and he was raped daily by many different men, apparently pimped to paying customers.The gang members explained that they would release the boy if Ms. Parveen returned to the brothel, and she contemplated suicide.After six weeks, Uzman escaped while his captors became drunk and left him unshackled. But when Ms. Parveen and her parents went to the police, the officers just laughed at them. Mr. Fareed and other gang members worked hand in glove with the police, the family says.Indeed, the police even arrested Ms. Parveen's father, who is one-legged because of a train accident (that is one reason for the family's poverty). Apparently on the gang's orders, the police held him for two weeks, in which time he says he was beaten mercilessly. The police are also searching for Ms. Parveen's brothers, who have gone into hiding.Mr. Fareed also threatened to kidnap and prostitute Ms. Parveen's younger sister, Naima, a 10th-grader who was ranked first in her class of 40 girls. Panic-stricken, the parents pulled Naima out of school and sent her to relatives far away. So her dreams of becoming a doctor have been dashed. (For readers who want to help, I've posted some suggestions on my blog: www.nytimes.com/ontheground.)This nexus of sex trafficking and police corruption is common in developing countries. The problem is typically not so much that laws are inadequate; it is that brothel owners buy the police and the courts.But Ms. Parveen's tale arises not only from corruption, but also from poverty.''If I had money, this wouldn't be happening,'' said Ms. Parveen's mother, Akbari Begum. ''It's all about money. In the police station, nobody listens to me. The police listen to those who sell narcotics.''''God should never grant daughters to poor people,'' she added. ''God should not give sisters to poor brothers. Because we're poor, we can't fight for them. It's very hard for poor people, because they take our daughters and dishonor them. There's nothing we can do.''Yet in a land where poor women and girls are victimized equally by pimps and by the police, they do have one savior -- Mukhtar Mai. She is the woman I've visited and written about often (she also uses the name Mukhtaran Bibi).After being sentenced to be gang-raped by a tribal council for a supposed offense of her brother, Mukhtar refused to commit suicide and instead prosecuted her attackers. And then she used compensation money (and donations from Times readers) to run schools and an aid organization for Pakistani women.It was in Mukhtar's extraordinary sanctuary that I met Ms. Parveen. In my Sunday column, I'll tell more about Mukhtar today.Op-Ed ColumnistYou might think that the worst tragedy that could befall a couple would be for their young daughter to be raped and murdered.But here in rural Pakistan, that was only the beginning for Hasina Bibi and her husband, Rashid Ahmed. Their story underscores how to be poor in the developing world often means having not only no food but also no justice -- and how any war against poverty must be devised not only to enrich the world's poorest people but also to educate and empower them.On the morning of July 3 last year, Ms. Hasina and Mr. Rashid were cutting grass in the fields along with their daughter, Shamshad, who was 11 years old, and a group of other laborers. Shamshad carried a stack of grass to a pile across the field -- and then disappeared.Villagers found Shamshad's body a few hours later. She had been raped and tortured: There were many bite marks, and burns from cigarettes.Everybody guessed who could have done this: the grandchildren of the local feudal lord. These grandchildren, in their teens and 20s, often harassed girls.The grandchildren, however, said that the culprits were their servants -- and so the police arrested the servants (who presumably would be beaten until they confessed). But Ms. Hasina and Mr. Rashid knew that the servants could not be guilty, because they had all been together when Shamshad vanished.''We went to the police, and after five minutes the police said, 'Go home,' '' Ms. Hasina related. The police told the parents to forget about making accusations against anyone in the feudal lord's family.So Ms. Hasina traveled to Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, 400 miles to the north, to appeal for assistance from the government -- but she received no help and her trip infuriated the feudal lord's family. The feudal lord's family members beat up her family members and warned them to be silent.''They said, 'We killed the girl, and if you don't keep quiet we'll kill all of you as well,' '' Ms. Hasina explained. She sighed and added: ''Everybody says, that is just what happens to poor people.''Yet there is one place that Ms. Hasina and Mr. Rashid have found a sanctuary: the shelter run by Mukhtar Mai here in the remote village of Meerwala. Mukhtar (who also goes by the name Mukhtaran Bibi) survived a gang rape to become a fervent campaigner for voiceless women in Pakistan.I've written about Mukhtar repeatedly over the last few years, and she now runs several schools, an ambulance service and a women's aid group. Her home and courtyard are full of women and girls who trickle in each day, shellshocked by injustice or disfigured by beatings or acid attacks. Mukhtar arranges medical or legal help and does what she can to address their needs.A year ago on a visit to Mukhtar's village, I wrote about a young woman named Aisha Parveen who was fighting efforts by the police to return her to the brothel from which she had escaped. Mukhtar helped rescue Aisha, and now Aisha is trying to replicate Mukhtar's work farther south. One of Aisha's first cases was to help Ms. Hasina after her daughter's murder.Mukhtar is a hero of mine. But her work has earned her many enemies, particularly among the feudal lords -- and even in the government of President Pervez Musharraf, who fears that Mukhtar displays Pakistan's dirty laundry before the world. So the Pakistani authorities are harassing Mukhtar, trying to break her organization. (For readers who want to help, I've posted some ideas on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground.)Most of the pressure right now is on Mukhtar's top aide and soul mate, Naseem Akhtar. Lately Naseem's brother was in a mysterious vehicle accident, her father was ordered arrested for no apparent reason and her own house was broken into.Farooq Leghari, a police chief, was transferred away from Meerwala because -- he and others say -- he tried too hard to protect Mukhtar. He now is police chief in another town and, when I visited him, he told me that ''this harassment and pressure on them is from very high up, from Islamabad.''''Their lives are in danger,'' Mr. Leghari said of Mukhtar and Naseem, adding that they could be killed by assassins sent by feudal lords or by the Pakistani government itself (our close allies!).So I have a message for President Musharraf: Don't even think about it. Start protecting Mukhtar instead of harassing her. And if any ''accident'' happens to Mukhtar or Naseem, you will be held responsible before the world. We are watching.Op-Ed ColumnistPresident Bush has become a bosom buddy of President Pervez Musharraf and sealed that friendship with $10 billion in military aid, but any American official who praises Pakistan's ''democracy'' might want to visit this bullet-scarred village in the Punjab.Dummerwala held free local elections here last year. But many people voted the ''wrong'' way, causing the candidate of the local feudal lord to lose. So a day after the election, a small army of gunmen arrived and began rampaging through the houses of the clan members who opposed the lord's choice.Waheed Rahman, a top student, 14 years old, who dreamed of becoming an engineer, was wounded in the opening minutes of the attack.''When he was shot, Waheed fell down and begged for water,'' said his father, Matiullah. ''They were surrounding him. But they just laughed and shot at the water tank and destroyed it. Then they ripped the clothes off the women and dragged them around half-naked.''For the next two hours, the attackers beat the men and abused the women, destroyed homes, and told their victims that the feudal lord had arranged for the police to stay away so he could teach them a lesson.Indeed, the police did stay away. Even when two of the villagers escaped and ran to the police station, begging the officers to stop the violence, the police delayed moving for three hours.By the time it was over, a woman was dying, as was Waheed, and many others were wounded.The attack here in Dummerwala is a reminder that democracy is about far more than free elections. In Pakistan, many rural areas remain under the thumb of feudal lords who use the government to keep themselves rich and everyone else impoverished.For real democracy to come to Pakistan, we'll need to see not only free elections and the retirement of President Musharraf, but also a broad effort to uproot the feudal rulers in areas like this, 300 miles south of Islamabad. That's not easy to do, but promoting education is the best way to combat both feudalism and fundamentalism.Instead, we've been focusing on selling arms and excusing General Musharraf's one-man rule.Husain Haqqani of Boston University calculates that the overt and trackable U.S. aid to General Musharraf's Pakistan amounted to $9.8 billion -- of which 1 percent went for children's survival and health, and just one-half of 1 percent for democracy promotion (and even that went partly to a commission controlled by General Musharraf).The big beneficiary of U.S. largesse hasn't been the Pakistani people, but the Pakistani Army.General Musharraf has done an excellent job of nurturing Pakistan's economy, but he is an autocrat. As Asma Jahangir, a prominent lawyer in Lahore, told me: ''Until now, Pakistanis have hated the American government but not the American people. But I'm afraid that may change. Unless the U.S. distances itself from Musharraf, the way things are going Pakistanis will come to hate the American people as well.''Just last week, General Musharraf's secret police goons roughed up and sexually molested Dr. Amna Buttar, an American doctor of Pakistani origin who heads a human rights organization. Dr. Buttar says that she had been warned by a senior intelligence official not to protest against the government and that she was specifically targeted when she protested anyway.When our ''antiterrorism'' funds support General Musharraf's thugs as they terrorize American citizens, it's time to rethink our approach. Imagine if we had spent $10 billion not building up General Musharraf, but supporting Pakistani schools.One place we could support a school is here in Dummerwala. After the attack, the victims in the village were so panicky that they pulled all their children out of school.''They say, 'If you don't cooperate with us, we will kill your sons,' '' said Tazeel Rahman, one of the victims. ''This is not democracy. This is a dictatorship. This is terrorism.''(When I interviewed the attackers, they insisted that the victims had simply killed themselves. They compensated for this wildly implausible version of events by sending an armed mob to persuade me of its merits.)We Americans could learn something about democracy from the brave people here. The villagers insist that if they are still alive and allowed to vote, they will again defy their feudal lord in the next election.We in the West sometimes say that poor countries like Pakistan aren't ready for democracy. But who takes democracy more seriously: Americans who routinely don't bother to vote, or peasants in Dummerwala who risk their lives to vote?Op-Ed ColumnistOne of the essential flaws in President Bush's Iraq policy is that America comes across as wanting to be in Iraq more than the Iraqis want us there.So in that context, the Congressional efforts to restrict funding for U.S. troops there don't undermine the war effort. Rather, they support it, by usefully signaling that American patience is wearing thin. The more we send that signal, the better off we and Iraq may be.Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney signal an unwavering commitment to supply American blood indefinitely to Iraq, and they are overseeing the development of military bases that frighten Iraqis because they look so permanent. The results are perceptions of nefarious American designs on Iraq, consequent Arab suspicions, empowerment of nationalist anti-Americans like Moktada al-Sadr, and an Iraqi government that feels insufficient pressure to make concessions to achieve a political solution. In short, the firmness of our resolve to stay is a military and diplomatic disaster that leads to more Americans coming home in body bags.The latest poll of Iraqis, by ABC News, USA Today and others, shows that 80 percent of Shiites and 97 percent of Sunni Arabs oppose the U.S. troop presence in Iraq, and over all, 51 percent support attacks on U.S. troops. But only 35 percent want the U.S. forces to leave immediately.That may seem a contradiction: why blow up Americans now if you still want them to stay a bit longer? But it makes sense to Iraqis, who believe that Mr. Bush is so determined to keep troops in Iraq that killing them today is the only way to dislodge them in a year's time.Likewise, Saudi Arabia's king, Abdullah, felt free to denounce the ''illegal foreign occupation'' of Iraq, even though he has made clear he wants it to continue for the time being, to protect the Sunni minority.If it looked as if Congress (or a new president) might actually bring the troops home, the tone might change, and we might start hearing pleas for us to stay a little longer.Look, neither I nor anyone else has a good solution to the mess in Iraq, and there is a real risk of a genocidal bloodbath after our departure. I'm not sure that the policy I've been advocating (a timetable for withdrawal within one year, accompanied by a clear renunciation of permanent bases in Iraq) would work. But I am sure that no American policy will ever succeed as long as we want to be in Iraq more than the Iraqis want us there.There's a parallel with South Korea, where the U.S. troop presence outraged Korean nationalists for decades. We showed great public resolve and determination to stay in Korea, and there was constant resentment at our troops' behavior and at the land taken up by our bases. It was an article of faith among many Koreans that we were there not to protect them but for our own dark purposes.Then a few years ago, Donald Rumsfeld ordered U.S. troops pulled back from the border with North Korea, and there was talk of slashing the U.S. troop presence. Suddenly, the U.S. force in Korea didn't seem so inevitable or permanent. Instead of grousing about the U.S. troops, some Koreans began to worry about the risk that they might be withdrawn. By showing ambivalence of our own, we actually created more support for our troops.You saw something similar in former Soviet bloc countries like Mongolia, where ordinary people used to roundly denounce the way they were exploited by the Soviets. Then with the collapse of old military and economic arrangements in 1990, the former satellites shifted to worrying how they would get by without the Soviets.That's the kind of change of tone we need in Iraq, and it would have a second salutary effect.The best hope for peace in Iraq is a political settlement, in which Shiite leaders make political concessions to bring Sunnis out of the insurgency and into decision making. That's the only real way out of this civil war. But as long as Shiite leaders see that Mr. Bush is determined to keep troops in Iraq to protect their rule, they don't make the necessary compromises.So instead of signaling that we will stay in Iraq to the last gasp, President Bush should be showing ambivalence of his own, signs that our commitment is not open-ended. He seems incapable of that.Now Congress is rising to the occasion -- and the resulting battle over troop funding sends the right signal to Iraq and the world, that we might actually pull out. In this case, a mixed message is the right message.Op-Ed ColumnistPerhaps the most surprising thing about President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan isn't that he has presided over the systematic slaughter of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children who are members of black African tribes.It is that President Bashir's own family appears to come from an African tribe. Yes, Mr. Bashir has led a genocide against people like himself.As best I can establish from my contacts in Sudan, Mr. Bashir's grandfather was from the Falata tribe and grew up in Nigeria. He migrated to Sudan to work on the Gezira irrigation project and settled in a village called Um Audam.Then the grandfather was killed in a dispute, and Mr. Bashir's father and grandmother moved to Hash Banaga in the Arab north. Mr. Bashir grew up speaking Arabic, so in that sense he is Arab -- but by heritage he is Falata and a black African.Americans often misunderstand genocide, assuming it is impossible to stop because it is driven by millenniums of racial or ethnic hatreds. But historically genocide has mostly been rooted in cool, calculated decisions by national leaders that the most convenient way to solve a problem or stay in power is to scapegoat and destroy a particular group. So it has been in most past genocides, and so it is again in Darfur.Nor is Mr. Bashir the only person in such a position. The on-and-off leader of the janjaweed militias, Musa Hilal, has unleashed his soldiers with particular brutality on another black African tribe, the Zaghawa. You can drive for hours through Zaghawa regions of Darfur where every single village has been burned; only corpses are left, and some of those have been stuffed into wells to poison them.Yet, according to people from Musa Hilal's hometown, his own mother is Zaghawa.Likewise, the rebels of Darfur have sometimes turned on their own tribes -- raping and murdering their own people, or those of allied tribes.So what motivates these people? Not ancient hatreds, but greed. They are not Taliban-style extremists, but rather amoral, ruthless, calculating opportunists.Mr. Bashir and others in his government faced a genuine problem back in 2003: African tribes (including the Zaghawa) were staging a rebellion in Darfur. Calling in the army to fight the rebels was problematic because many soldiers in the regular army are from African tribes in Darfur and might not be reliable in combat against their brethren.So Mr. Bashir adopted an approach he had already used against rebels in southern Sudan. He armed irregular militias and gave them license to wipe out civilians and depopulate large areas. This would deprive the rebels of their base of support and send a warning to any other tribe in Sudan that might contemplate a rebellion.Presumably Mr. Bashir guessed that foreigners might not like the idea of mass murder. But he could deny visas to prying journalists, and he had Chinese diplomatic protection at the United Nations.So after weighing the pros and cons, Mr. Bashir decided that genocide was the simplest counterinsurgency method. Some of the marauders were driven by prejudice, and Arab attackers routinely shouted racial epithets against blacks. But the leaders ---- they were just cynics. Musa Hilal and some of the rebel commanders seemed to view murder and rape simply as paths to accumulate power and livestock.All this makes genocide easier to stop than people imagine. Where it arises from a weighing of costs and benefits, then it is possible for outsiders to impose additional costs and change the outcome. That's what we need to do. The U.S. should lead other countries in pushing hard on all sides for a negotiated peace agreement among the warring factions, for that is ultimately the best hope to end the slaughter in Darfur and in neighboring areas in Chad and the Central African Republic.I find President Bashir's ruthlessness pretty easy to understand. What is harder to fathom is President Bush's refusal to stand up to the genocide for four years. Why not impose a no-fly zone, why not hold an international conference on Darfur, why not invite survivors to the White House for a photo-op, why not give a prime-time speech about Darfur?Perhaps the explanation for Mr. Bush's passivity is the same as the explanation for Mr. Bashir's brutality. Maybe Mr. Bush has made his calculations, looked at the number of calls and letters he gets about Darfur, weighed the pros and cons, and decided that Americans really don't care enough about genocide to make him pay a major price for allowing it to continue.Op-Ed ColumnistAnyone who thinks that the word ''slavery'' is hyperbole when used to describe human trafficking today should meet Meena Khatun. She not only endured the unbearable, but has also shown that a slave trader's greed sometimes is no match for a mother's love.Human trafficking is the big emerging human rights issue for the 21st century, but it's an awful term, a convoluted euphemism. As Meena's story underscores, the real issue is slavery.Meena was kidnapped from her village in north India by a trafficker and eventually locked up in a 13-girl brothel in the town of Katihar. When she was perhaps 11 or 12 -- she remembers only that it was well before she had begun to menstruate -- the slaver locked her in a room with a white-haired customer who had bought her virginity. She cried and fought, so the mother and two sons who owned the brothel taught Meena a lesson.''They beat me mercilessly, with a belt, sticks and iron rods,'' Meena recalled. Still, Meena resisted customers, despite fresh beatings and threats to cut her in pieces.Finally, the brothel owners forced her to drink alcohol until she was drunk. When she passed out, they gave her to a customer.When she woke up, Meena finally accepted her fate as a prostitute. ''I thought, 'Now I am ruined,' '' she remembered, ''so I gave in.''Meena thus joined the ranks of some 10 million children prostituted around the world -- more are in India than in any other country. The brothels of India are the slave plantations of the 21st century.Every night, Meena was forced to have sex with 10 to 25 customers. Meena's owners also wanted to breed her, as is common in Indian brothels. One purpose is to have boys to be laborers and girls to be prostitutes, and a second is to have hostages to force the mother to cooperate.So Meena soon became pregnant. The resulting baby girl, Naina, was taken from Meena after birth, as was a son, Vivek, who was born a year later.The two children were raised mostly apart from Meena. Meena alerted the police to her children's captivity (the police were uninterested), so her owners decided to kill her.At that, Meena fled to a town several hours away and eventually married a pharmacist who protected her. Every few months, Meena would go back to the brothel and beg for her children.She was never allowed inside, and the children were told that their mother had died. Still, Naina and Vivek regularly heard their mother's shouts and pleas and occasionally caught glimpses of her. Other enslaved girls told them that she was indeed their mother.When Naina turned about 12, the brothel owners prepared to sell her as well. At that Vivek, who was being forced to do the brothel's laundry, protested vigorously. The owners beat Vivek, an extremely bright boy who was never allowed to go to school, but he continued to plead that his big sister not be sold. Finally, he escaped to search for his mother, in hopes that she could do something. Eventually, they found each other.They received help from a terrific anti-trafficking organization called Apne Aap (www.apneaap.org), run by a former journalist named Ruchira Gupta. Ms. Gupta covered trafficking and was so horrified by what she found that she quit her job and devoted her life to fighting the brothel owners.Ms. Gupta agitated for a police raid (apparently the first such raid on behalf of a trafficked mother ever in the state of Bihar) that rescued Naina last month. The girl, who is now about 13, is still recovering in a hospital from severe beatings and internal injuries.The brothel is still operating, and the police have not arrested the main traffickers. But the brothel owners are threatening to kill Meena, her children and the Apne Aap staff, because they are potential witnesses in a criminal case against the traffickers. One Apne Aap staff member was stabbed a few days ago.But whatever happens to Meena or Vivek, they are in the vanguard of a new global abolitionist movement. (Video of them and the brothels can be found on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground.)This is an issue crying out for world leaders -- and community groups -- to seize and run with. President Bush has pressed the issue more than his predecessors, but he could do much more. If a little boy like Vivek can stand up to modern slavers, why can't world leaders do the same?Op-Ed ColumnistIndia is stirring after many centuries of torpor, and it has a chance of ending this century as the capital of the world, the most important nation on earth. You see up-and-coming cities like Hyderabad or Ahmedabad, and it's easy to believe that India will eventually surpass China.But here in rural Bihar state in northern India, there's no economic miracle to be seen. And it's difficult to see how India can emerge on top unless it takes advantage of its greatest untapped resource: its rural population.The village of Khawaspur has no electricity. It has a school with 600 students, but -- as is common in Indian state schools -- many teachers show up only rarely. ''We go to school, but the teachers don't,'' explained Doli, a second-grade girl.On a typical day there will be just one or two teachers in the whole school, and the students learn next to nothing. ''You have to bribe your way to be a teacher there,'' explained Yogender Singh, who tutors children for payment.No child I met in Khawaspur had ever been vaccinated for anything. And the local government hospital exists only in theory.''There is a hospital,'' said a villager named Muhammad Shaukat. ''But there's not even a door or a window. Forget about a doctor.''That's a common problem: the government pays for schools, clinics or vaccinations, but someone pockets the money and no education or health care materializes.In a village in Gujarat that I visited on this trip, all the children were out of school because the teachers had decided to take a monthlong vacation. One sixth-grade student, Ramila, could not write her name, not even in Gujarati.Another sixth grader, Janah, said that when it came time for exams, the teachers wrote the answers on the blackboard for students to copy so the exam results wouldn't embarrass the school.Then there's the toll of malnutrition. India has more malnourished children than any country in the world and one of the highest rates of malnutrition, 30 to 47 percent, depending on who does the estimating.Those malnourished children suffer permanent losses in I.Q. and cognition, and are easy prey for diseases. There is some evidence that widespread malnutrition lowers economic growth in affected countries by two to four percentage points a year.So in the middle of this century, India will still be held back by its failure to educate, feed and vaccinate its children today. This failure will haunt India for many decades to come. Sure, China has many similar problems, with growing gaps between rich and poor and an interior that is being left far behind. But rural Chinese schools provide a basic education, including solid math and science skills.India's boom is real, and its overall growth rate puts India right at China's heels. Its middle class is expanding, governance is improving, and the transformation is one of the most exciting things going on in the world today. The 21st century will belong to Asia, and young Americans need to study Asia, live in it and learn its languages.But Indians refer to the ''Bimaru'' states -- a play on the word ''bimar,'' which means ''sick'' in Hindi. The Bimaru states are Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, and Orissa deserves a spot as well.In the Bimaru states, there is no boom. ''We see nothing here,'' said Vidya Sagar Gupta, a businessman who once operated many factories in northern Bihar. Now he has closed most of them down and is trying to sell his properties.Electricity is unreliable, crime is growing, corruption is endless, the agricultural sector is in crisis, supplies are difficult to get, and criminal gangs and politics are so interwoven that it is difficult to foresee improvements, he says.For anyone who wants to see this country succeed, a visit to rural India is a bitter disappointment. Ela Bhatt, who founded the Self-Employed Women's Association, a union of poor women that now has nearly one million members, told me that India's economy is profoundly limited: ''It is like a car having one motorized tire, and the others are cart wheels.''So in the great race of this century, the race to see which country will lead the world in 2100, I'm still betting on China for now. I'm having my kids learn Chinese, not Hindi (or Indian English, a remarkable language in its own right).Until India's economic boom becomes much more broadly based, and until Indian schools manage to teach their students, this country will continue to waste its precious brainpower and won't achieve a fraction of what it should.Op-Ed ColumnistIn May 2003, Iran sent a secret proposal to the U.S. for settling our mutual disputes in a ''grand bargain.''It is an astonishing document, for it tries to address a range of U.S. concerns about nuclear weapons, terrorism and Iraq. I've placed it and related documents (including multiple drafts of it) on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground.Hard-liners in the Bush administration killed discussions of a deal, and interviews with key players suggest that was an appalling mistake. There was a real hope for peace; now there is a real danger of war.Scattered reports of the Iranian proposal have emerged previously, but if you read the full documentary record you'll see that what the hard-liners killed wasn't just one faxed Iranian proposal but an entire peace process. The record indicates that officials from the repressive, duplicitous government of Iran pursued peace more energetically and diplomatically than senior Bush administration officials -- which makes me ache for my country.The process began with Afghanistan in 2001-2. Iran and the U.S., both opponents of the Taliban, cooperated closely in stabilizing Afghanistan and providing aid, and unofficial ''track two'' processes grew to explore opportunities for improved relations.On the U.S. side, track two involved well-connected former U.S. ambassadors, including Thomas Pickering, Frank Wisner and Nicholas Platt. The Iranian ambassador to the U.N., Javad Zarif, was a central player, as was an Iranian-American professor at Rutgers, Hooshang Amirahmadi, who heads a friendship group called the American Iranian Council.At a dinner the council sponsored for its board at Ambassador Zarif's home in September 2002, the group met Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi. According to the notes of Professor Amirahmadi, the foreign minister told the group, ''Yes, we are ready to normalize relations,'' provided the U.S. made the first move.This was shaping into a historic opportunity to heal U.S.-Iranian relations, and the track two participants discussed further steps, including joint U.S.-Iranian cooperation against Saddam Hussein. The State Department and National Security Council were fully briefed, and in 2003 Ambassador Zarif met with two U.S. officials, Ryan Crocker and Zalmay Khalilzad, in a series of meetings in Paris and Geneva.Encouraged, Iran transmitted its ''grand bargain'' proposals to the U.S. One version was apparently a paraphrase by the Swiss ambassador in Tehran; that was published this year in The Washington Post.But Iran also sent its own master text of the proposal to the State Department and, through an intermediary, to the White House. I've also posted that document, which Iran regards as the definitive one.In the master document, Iran talks about ensuring ''full transparency'' and other measures to assure the U.S. that it will not develop nuclear weapons. Iran offers ''active Iranian support for Iraqi stabilization.'' Iran also contemplates an end to ''any material support to Palestinian opposition groups'' while pressuring Hamas ''to stop violent actions against civilians within'' Israel (though not the occupied territories). Iran would support the transition of Hezbollah to be a ''mere political organization within Lebanon'' and endorse the Saudi initiative calling for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Iran also demanded a lot, including ''mutual respect,'' abolition of sanctions, access to peaceful nuclear technology and a U.S. statement that Iran did not belong in the ''axis of evil.'' Many crucial issues, including verification of Iran's nuclear program, needed to be hammered out. It's not clear to me that a grand bargain was reachable, but it was definitely worth pursuing -- and still is today.Instead, Bush administration hard-liners aborted the process. Another round of talks had been scheduled for Geneva, and Ambassador Zarif showed up -- but not the U.S. side. That undermined Iranian moderates.A U.S.-Iranian rapprochement could have saved lives in Iraq, isolated Palestinian terrorists and encouraged civil society groups in Iran. But instead the U.S. hard-liners chose to hammer plowshares into swords.I've chosen the two winners of my second annual ''win-a-trip contest.'' One is Leana Wen, a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis. The second is Will Okun, who teaches at Westside Alternative High School in Chicago and dabbles in photography and writing.Leana, Will and I will travel together through Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Congo. Stay tuned.Op-Ed ColumnistIn this presidential campaign, we need somebody who wants to address the question President Bush once raised: ''Is our children learning?''International testing shows that U.S. schools do a lousy job teaching math and science, in particular. And far too many American students aren't going to college or even completing high school, undermining our competitiveness for decades to come.Moreover, the U.S. education system reinforces the gulfs of poverty and race. Well-off white kids tend to go to good schools that propel them ahead, while many poor black and Hispanic kids attend bad schools that hold them back.For inspiration, presidential candidates might look at this bold three-part plan for improving American schools:End requirements for teacher certification.Make tenure more difficult to get so weak teachers can be weeded out after two or three years on the job.Award $15,000 annual bonuses to good teachers for as long as they teach at schools in low-income areas.Those ideas are cribbed from a provocative report on education from the Hamilton Project, which is affiliated with the Brookings Institution. The report was prepared by Robert Gordon of the Center for American Progress, Thomas Kane of Harvard and Douglas Staiger of Dartmouth, and it fits in with a burst of other research pointing in similar directions.In the past, we tried to ensure the quality of teachers through certification procedures. But that has failed. Growing evidence indicates that certification requirements limit the pool of potential teachers -- and discourage midcareer switches into teaching -- without accomplishing much else.''Teachers vary considerably in the extent to which they promote student learning, but whether a teacher is certified or not is largely irrelevant to predicting their effectiveness,'' concluded a report last year for the National Bureau of Economic Research.The reality is that paper credentials can't predict who will be an effective teacher. A half-dozen studies have found that teachers with graduate degrees aren't any better than teachers without them. Other studies show that teachers who did well on their own SATs, or went to selective colleges or had high G.P.A.'s, don't make significantly better teachers, either.Yet teachers still vary tremendously in their effectiveness, as the Hamilton Project study found when it examined results in Los Angeles schools. It looked at the 25 percent of teachers who raised their students' test scores the most, and the 25 percent who raised students' scores the least. A student assigned to a class with a teacher in the top 25 percent could expect -- after just one year -- to be 10 percentile points higher than a similar student with a bottom-tier teacher.''Moving up (or down) 10 percentile points in one year is a massive impact,'' the authors wrote. ''For some perspective, the black-white achievement gap nationally is roughly 34 percentile points. Therefore, if the effects were to accumulate, having a top-quartile teacher rather than a bottom-quartile teacher four years in a row would be enough to close the black-white test score gap.''The Hamilton Project study recommends that the weakest 25 percent of new teachers should be denied tenure and eliminated after two or three years on the job (teachers improve a lot in the first two years, but not much after that). That approach, it estimates, would raise students' average test scores by 14 percentile points by the time they graduated.''There's no decision that school districts make that's more important than the decision regarding who is going to stand in front of the classroom,'' Professor Kane said. ''Yet most districts spend more time choosing textbooks than they do reviewing the performance of teachers on their first few years on the job.''School reform could also play a major role in fighting poverty and spreading opportunity. One sound proposal is to pay substantial bonuses to get the most effective teachers into schools with low-income students. It's simply unfair for America's neediest students to be continually assigned to the weakest teachers, perhaps consigning them to another generation of poverty. Higher pay will help recruit and retain excellent teachers.Neither Democrats nor Republicans have offered much leadership on education. Democrats have been too close to teachers' unions to rock the boat, and Republicans don't invest in education -- so Mr. Bush's No Child Left Behind effort has ended up as an underfinanced mess.What we need now is for a presidential candidate to seize these ideas and run with them. Any takers?Op-Ed ColumnistBefore I get to the ''but,'' let me say that Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a terrific president.She has spent decades wrestling with public policy questions about poverty and health care. She is smart and pragmatic on foreign policy issues. And while it would be tough for a liberal or centrist woman to be elected (it's much easier for a conservative like Margaret Thatcher), the rising Democratic tide increasingly makes her look electable.But  there is another issue at stake, one that goes to the heart of what kind of a nation we are.If Mrs. Clinton were elected and served two terms, then for seven consecutive presidential terms the White House would have been in the hands of just two families. That's just not the kind of equal-opportunity democracy we aspire to. Maybe we can't make America as egalitarian and fluid as we would like, but we can at least push back against the concentration of power. We can do that in our tax policy, in our education policy -- and in our voting decisions.The political aristocracy in this country is more fluid than past nobility, and that is how the Clinton family entered it. But the benefit of membership in that aristocracy has probably increased over time, as larger Congressional districts and the rising cost of campaigns make it harder for an unfinanced unknown to rise in politics.Particularly after George W. Bush rose to the White House partly because he inherited a name and rolodexes of donors from a previous president, we should take a deep breath before replacing one dynasty with another.America's history is based on a rejection of aristocracy. It's true that in our early years, most of our leaders were wealthy elites -- and, frankly, they did a superior job. But one of our most fateful elections came in 1828, ''the revolution of 1828,'' with the rise of Andrew Jackson.Jackson, the rough-hewn fighter, a former child soldier, defeated John Quincy Adams, who symbolized all the daintiness, education and sophistication of the aristocracy that had ruled until that time.John Quincy Adams was the better man (if Andrew Jackson were reading this, he would challenge me to a duel, which proves my point). But Jackson's election was a healthy milestone for our democracy in that it truly opened up American politics.It would be unhealthy to vote for or against a person solely because of his or her family. But where there is a pool of similar candidates, it seems reasonable to count inherited (and wedded) advantage as one factor -- and to put a thumb on the scales of those who rose on their own.Granted, Mitt Romney and Al Gore are also children of the American political aristocracy. And I wouldn't argue that Mrs. Clinton should be excluded from consideration -- just that it's reasonable to count as a factor that her family has already lived in the White House.In South Asia -- Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka -- it has been common for a spouse or child to inherit a political office. But that always has the feel of a politically immature democracy. It would feel very Sri Lankan if we had a father-son series and a husband-wife series of presidents.And if Jeb Bush succeeds Hillary Clinton in the White House, I'll flee to Sri Lanka.There is one important counterargument -- raised, perhaps not surprisingly, by my wife. It is that if our aim is to open up the political system and broaden opportunity, then what better way than to elect a woman?It's true that the election of a first woman (or black or Hispanic) might well nourish the American political system, just as the election of John Kennedy as the first Catholic did in 1960. But, as in Argentina or Bangladesh, the election of a first woman loses much of its significance if she has enjoyed a political shortcut as a predecessor's wife.If we really want a presidential dynasty, then that's fine. But we shouldn't back into it without discussion -- for the second time in eight years.American democracy was diminished in its infancy by the way power was largely held by a narrow nobility, however talented. Do we really want to embrace a similar concentration of power in the 21st century?I'm holding another contest for poetry about the Iraq war. Details are on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground -- or just send your (short) poem to iraqpoems@gmail.com.Paul Krugman is on vacation.Op-Ed ColumnistFinally, we're beginning to understand what it would take to galvanize President Bush, other leaders and the American public to respond to the genocide in Sudan: a suffering puppy with big eyes and floppy ears.That's the implication of a series of studies by psychologists trying to understand why people -- good, conscientious people -- aren't moved by genocide or famines. Time and again, we've seen that the human conscience just isn't pricked by mass suffering, while an individual child (or puppy) in distress causes our hearts to flutter.In one experiment, psychologists asked ordinary citizens to contribute $5 to alleviate hunger abroad. In one version, the money would go to a particular girl, Rokia, a 7-year-old in Mali; in another, to 21 million hungry Africans; in a third, to Rokia -- but she was presented as a victim of a larger tapestry of global hunger.Not surprisingly, people were less likely to give to anonymous millions than to Rokia. But they were also less willing to give in the third scenario, in which Rokia's suffering was presented as part of a broader pattern.Evidence is overwhelming that humans respond to the suffering of individuals rather than groups. Think of the toddler Jessica McClure falling down a well in 1987, or the Lindbergh baby kidnapping in 1932 (which Mencken described as the ''the biggest story since the Resurrection'').Even the right animal evokes a similar sympathy. A dog stranded on a ship aroused so much pity that $48,000 in private money was spent trying to rescue it -- and that was before the Coast Guard stepped in. And after I began visiting Darfur in 2004, I was flummoxed by the public's passion to save a red-tailed hawk, Pale Male, that had been evicted from his nest on Fifth Avenue in New York City. A single homeless hawk aroused more indignation than two million homeless Sudanese.Advocates for the poor often note that 30,000 children die daily of the consequences of poverty -- presuming that this number will shock people into action. But the opposite is true: the more victims, the less compassion.In one experiment, people in one group could donate to a $300,000 fund for medical treatments that would save the life of one child -- or, in another group, the lives of eight children. People donated more than twice as much money to help save one child as to help save eight.Likewise, remember how people were asked to save Rokia from starvation? A follow-up allowed students to donate to Rokia or to a hungry boy named Moussa. Both Rokia and Moussa attracted donations in the same proportions. Then another group was asked to donate to Rokia and Moussa together. But donors felt less good about supporting two children, and contributions dropped off.''Our capacity to feel is limited,'' Paul Slovic of the University of Oregon writes in a new journal article, ''Psychic Numbing and Genocide,'' which discusses these experiments. Professor Slovic argues that we cannot depend on the innate morality even of good people. Instead, he believes, we need to develop legal or political mechanisms to force our hands to confront genocide.So, yes, we should develop early-warning systems for genocide, prepare an African Union, U.N. and NATO rapid-response capability, and polish the ''responsibility to protect'' as a legal basis to stop atrocities. (The Genocide Intervention Network and the Enough project are working on these things.)But, frankly, after four years of watching the U.N. Security Council, the International Criminal Court and the Genocide Convention accomplish little in Darfur, I'm skeptical that either human rationality or international law can achieve much unless backed by a public outcry.One experiment underscored the limits of rationality. People prepared to donate to the needy were first asked either to talk about babies (to prime the emotions) or to perform math calculations (to prime their rational side). Those who did math donated less.So maybe what we need isn't better laws but more troubled consciences -- pricked, perhaps, by a Darfur puppy with big eyes and floppy ears. Once we find such a soulful dog in peril, we should call ABC News. ABC's news judgment can be assessed by the 11 minutes of evening news coverage it gave to Darfur's genocide during all of last year -- compared with 23 minutes for the false confession in the JonBenet Ramsey case.If President Bush and the global public alike are unmoved by the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of fellow humans, maybe our last, best hope is that we can be galvanized by a puppy in distress.Op-Ed ColumnistOne of the most unusual people in New Jersey these days is a tall 34-year-old black man named Daoud Hari. Others may lose their tempers at traffic jams on the turnpike, but he's just glad he's no longer being tortured.Mr. Hari has just arrived in the U.S. from Chad and Darfur, where he says he was beaten and told repeatedly he was going to be executed. He is one of just a handful of Darfuris -- his lawyer knows of two others -- whom the U.S. has accepted as refugees.I knew Mr. Hari in his previous life, because he interpreted for me early last year. We journeyed together along the Darfur-Chad border through a no man's land of villages that were being attacked by Sudan's janjaweed militia.Mr. Hari helped me interview two orphan boys living under a tree, a 13-year-old girl shot in the chest, a 6-year-old boy trying desperately not to cry as doctors treated shrapnel wounds to his leg and a 15-year-old girl gang-raped by the janjaweed.It is a different world there. It is the antipodes of New Jersey.When our vehicle became stuck in the sand in one janjaweed area, we strained side by side to push it out before trouble arrived. We slept in the sand under the stars, we saw gruesome injuries, we witnessed people preparing to be killed, and we saw each other dusty and frightened. In that crucible, I grew steadily more impressed with Mr. Hari's courage, for as a local person he was at greater risk of immediate execution than a foreigner like me.He was scared, of course, but what drove him was a relentless determination to get out the story of what was happening to his fellow Darfuris. He was determined to fight genocide with the best weapon he had, his training in English.Interpreters and drivers are the secret to good international reporting, and they do much of the work, take most of the risks and get none of the credit. Mr. Hari regularly interpreted for other journalists, repeatedly putting himself in danger to get out the stories.Last August, he accompanied an ace Chicago Tribune reporter, Paul Salopek, into Darfur, but they were seized by an armed faction. Once, he said, a commander ordered his soldiers to execute him, but they were from the same tribe and balked. Another time, he says, a commander untied him and told him to escape -- but he refused unless the driver was freed as well. So Mr. Hari was tied up again, and he was beaten as he was interrogated about his work with me and other journalists.Finally, after more than a month, Sudan freed Mr. Hari along with Mr. Salopek and the driver. Eventually Mr. Hari made his way back to Chad, and the U.S. granted him status as a political refugee. It is disorienting to be with him here, where we are both clean, rested and safe.Yet even here Mr. Hari is haunted by Darfur. He knows one brother was killed; the other was attacked and beaten, but Mr. Hari assumes he is still alive. Of his three sisters, Mr. Hari last saw one in 2003 and the others in 2006.He plans to study and is also determined to speak out about Darfur and tell Americans what is happening to his people.Mr. Hari's presence in the U.S. underscores a profound difference between Darfur and past genocides: In the past, we could always claim that we didn't fully appreciate what was going on until too late.It was only a faint reed of an excuse, for in fact information always did trickle out about past genocides even as they were underway. But this time we can't even feign ignorance.A superb new documentary, ''The Devil Came on Horseback,'' provides a wrenching tour through the eyes of a tormented American military observer there. A handful of books chronicle the killings; one of them, ''Not on Our Watch,'' has hit the best-seller list with its suggestions for what citizens can do. President Bush has described the slaughter in Darfur as genocide since 2004.Google Earth has developed a first-rate program to observe the devastation from above. On my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground, you can see a man whose eyes were gouged out by the janjaweed as well as video from the journey last year with Mr. Hari.Or, if you live in New Jersey, you can simply turn to one of your newest neighbors, and see the pain in his eyes as he wonders if his sisters are still alive.Op-Ed ColumnistAs Paul Wolfowitz is to the World Bank, the U.S. is becoming to the world.We should look at the battle unfolding at the World Bank not as the story of one man falling to earth, but as a moral tale of the risks the U.S. faces unless the Bush administration spends more time rebuilding bridges it has burned all over the world.Mr. Wolfowitz genuinely aspired to help Africa develop, but he ended up isolated, friendless and vulnerable; receiving no credit for his genuine accomplishments; and unable to make progress on the issues he cares about. And the U.S. is in a similar position today.The similarity arises in part because although President Bush's best-known role has been as a conservative hawk -- and everything he has done in that role has been a disaster -- he has also aspired to fight poverty and help Africa. And Mr. Bush has genuinely scored some major accomplishments as a humanitarian.O.K., pick yourself off the floor: It's true. In the world of foreign aid, Mr. Bush has done better than almost anyone realizes -- or gives him credit for. It's his only significant positive legacy, and it consists of four elements.First and most important, Mr. Bush started Pepfar, his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa -- the best single thing he has done in his life. It's a huge increase over earlier programs and will save more than 9 million lives. Granted, it has been too ideological about promoting ''abstinence only'' programs, but at the grass-roots level it is increasingly pragmatic (don't tell the White House, but the U.S. still gives out far more condoms than any other country).Second, Mr. Bush started a major new foreign aid program, the millennium challenge account. This involves giving large sums to countries selected for their good governance and from top to bottom reflects smart new approaches to foreign aid.Third, the Bush administration elevated sex trafficking on the international agenda. Mr. Bush spoke about it to the U.N., and he appointed a first-rate ambassador for the issue, John Miller, who until his resignation late last year hectored and sanctioned foreign countries into curbing this form of modern slavery. (Alas, since Mr. Miller left, the administration's anti-trafficking efforts have faltered.)Fourth, Mr. Bush has begun to focus attention and funds on malaria, which kills more than 1 million people a year in poor countries and imposes a huge economic burden on Africa in particular.So why doesn't Mr. Bush get any credit for these achievements? Partly, I think, because he never seems very interested in them himself. And partly because, like Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Bush's approach to governing is to circle the wagons rather than build coalitions; they both antagonize fence-sitters by coming across as unilateralist, sanctimonious, arrogant and incompetent.In December, the White House held an event to call attention to malaria. But Mr. Bush's staff barred me from attending: They apparently didn't want coverage of malaria if it came from a columnist they didn't like.I can't recall an administration as suspicious and partisan as this one, one so disinclined to outreach, one that so openly adheres to the ancient Roman maxim of Oderint dum metuant: Let them hate, so long as they fear.So Mr. Bush, unwilling to concede any error, unwilling to reach out, unwilling to shuffle his cabinet, staggers on. And the U.S. itself has been tainted by the same haughtiness; long after Mr. Wolfowitz has gone, and even after Mr. Bush has gone, the next president will have to detoxify our relations with the rest of the world.Moreover, even in those areas where Mr. Bush has done well, like foreign aid, our strained relations with the rest of the world have undermined our ability to succeed. Indeed, Bill Clinton (who wasn't nearly as generous with foreign aid as Mr. Bush when he was in the White House) has shown in recent years how much can be accomplished when a leader cooperates with partners on issues like AIDS and development. If Mr. Clinton were pursuing Mr. Bush's development agenda, it would be in a flurry of meetings and visits and multilateralism that would be far more effective in seeing that agenda put in place.But instead the international stage is riven in ways that mirror the World Bank itself. And it looks as if we're drifting toward the end of a failed presidency of the United States that parallels Mr. Wolfowitz's failed presidency of the World Bank.Op-Ed ColumnistHow's this for a glimpse into America's health care mess:The student winner I've chosen to accompany me on a reporting trip to Africa next month is a superb medical school student named Leana Wen. She receives her M.D. this month, and will research health care access this summer at a Washington think tank.I asked Leana about her health insurance coverage, just in case she catches leprosy on the Africa trip.''Actually, I was going to become one of the 45 million uninsured for the summer,'' she said. ''The think tank does not provide insurance for 'temporary' employees, and my school did not allow extension of health insurance post-graduation. I still haven't found a reasonably priced insurance plan for this period.''Aaaaargh! When a newly minted doctor investigating Americans' access to medical care has no insurance -- then you know that our health care system is truly bankrupt.Let's hope that the presidential campaign helps lead us toward a new health care system. John Edwards has set the standard by proposing a serious and detailed plan for national health care reform, and other candidates should follow.The medical and insurance lobbies have been busy blocking national health care programs since they were first seriously proposed back in the 1920's -- and the result has been millions of premature deaths in this country because of people falling through the cracks. Doctors fighting universal coverage have been saving lives in their day jobs while costing lives with their lobbying.Over all, a person without insurance is less likely to have diseases diagnosed early, less likely to get routine preventive care -- and faces a 25 percent greater chance of dying early.Americans with good jobs and complex needs receive superb medical care. But a child in Costa Rica born today is expected to live longer than an American child born today.The U.S. now spends far more on medical care (more than $7,000 per person) than other nations, yet our infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate and longevity are among the worst in the industrialized world. If we had as good a child mortality rate as France, Germany and Italy, we would save 12,000 children a year.It is disgraceful that an American mother has almost three times the risk of losing a child as a mother in the Czech Republic. According to a new report from Save the Children, a woman in the U.S. has a 1-in-71 chance of losing a child before his or her fifth birthday.Some speculate that America's high infant mortality rate is partly a result of greater honesty about neonatal deaths or of more in vitro fertilizations. But even if those are factors, they don't explain why a woman is 50 percent more likely to die in childbirth in the U.S. than in Europe.The existing medical financing system also creates perverse incentives for expensive procedures; that may be why Americans are far more likely than Europeans to get C-sections. Meanwhile, the burden of paying for these second-rate statistical outcomes is crippling American business. By next year, the average Fortune 500 company will spend more on health care than it earns in net income, according to Steve Burd, the head of Safeway. Mr. Burd and other executives have formed the Coalition to Advance Healthcare Reform, creating a corporate constituency for national health reforms.There's evidence that the most efficient financing system would be a single-payer structure, such as that found in most Western countries. Some 31 percent of U.S. health spending goes to administration, more than twice the rate in Canada.So bravo to Physicians for a National Health Program, a group of 14,000 doctors and other health professionals that favors a single-payer system.But universal coverage is only part of the answer. We also need far greater attention to public health programs focusing on prevention. Two of the most important life-saving health interventions in recent decades weren't medical at all: the cigarette tax and laws mandating air bags and seat belt use. A national public health campaign on obesity (similar to the one Gov. Mike Huckabee started in Arkansas) should be an essential component of health care reform.Even if a single-payer system isn't politically possible right now, universal coverage is feasible through other mechanisms -- as Massachusetts has shown. We need to hold the presidential candidates accountable, for universal coverage is an idea whose time came in the 1920s. We should insist we get it before the 2020s.Op-Ed ColumnistThis is a city you've probably never heard of, yet it has a population of 10 million people who fill your dressers and closets. By one count, 40 percent of the sports shoes sold in the U.S. come from Dongguan.Just one neighborhood within Dongguan, Dalang, has become the Sweater Capital of the World. Dalang makes more than 300 million sweaters a year, of which 200 million are exported to the U.S.Keep towns like this in mind when American protectionists demand sanctions, after the latest round of talks ending yesterday made little progress. Some irresponsible Democrats in Congress would have you believe that China's economic success is simply the result of currency manipulation, unfair regulations and pirating American movies.It's true that China's currency is seriously undervalued. But places like Dongguan have thrived largely because of values we like to think of as American: ingenuity, diligence, entrepreneurship and respect for markets.The people in Dalang, the Sweater Capital, used to be farmers, until a Hong Kong investor opened a sweater factory at the dawn of the 1980's. After a few years, the workers began to quit and open their own factories, and both the bosses and the staff work dizzyingly hard. One factory worker here in Guangdong Province told me that she works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, 365 days a year, not even taking time off for Chinese New Year. She chooses to work these hours to gain a better life for her son. If protectionists want somebody to criticize for China's trade success, blame that woman and millions like her.Remember that China isn't like 1980s Japan, which had a sustained huge surplus with nearly everybody. China's global surplus has surged in the last five years, but traditionally its global trade position has been close to a balance, and it still has a trade deficit with many countries.China imports components, does the low-wage assembly, and then exports the finished products to the U.S. -- so the whole value appears in the Chinese trade surplus with the U.S., even though on average 65 percent of the value was imported into China. When a Chinese-made Barbie doll sells in the U.S. for $9.99, only 35 cents goes to China.Sure, China pirates movies and software -- but the U.S. was even worse at this stage of development (when we used to infuriate England by stealing its literary properties without paying royalties). Pirated DVDs are sold openly on the streets of Manhattan, while sellers in China can be far more creative. A couple of days ago, I dropped into a small DVD shop in Beijing to check its wares. Everything seemed legal.Then the two saleswomen asked if I wanted to see American movies -- and tugged at a bookshelf, which rolled forward on wheels. Behind was a door; one of the saleswomen whisked me into a secret room full of pirated DVDs. That's piracy -- but also capitalism at its harshest and hungriest. There are plenty of reasons to put pressure on China, including its imprisonment of journalists and its disgraceful role in supplying the weaponry used to commit genocide in Darfur. But whining about the efficiency of Chinese capitalism is beneath us.All that said, the Chinese development model is running out of steam.Labor shortages are growing and pushing up wage costs. Factories are having to spend more money to improve worker safety and curb pollution. The environment is such a disaster that 16 of the world's most polluted cities are now in China.China will also be forced to appreciate its undervalued currency, further pushing up costs. The ''China price'' will no longer be the world's lowest, and millions of jobs making T-shirts and stuffed toys will move to lower-wage countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.So if China is going to continue its historic rise, it will have to move up the technology ladder and shift to domestic consumption as its economic engine. Yet the share of consumption in China's economy has fallen significantly since 2000.So as one who has been profoundly optimistic about China for the last 25 years, I think it's time to sober up. President Hu Jintao is China's least visionary leader since Hua Guofeng 30 years ago, and China has the burden of unusually weak leadership as it navigates a transition to a new economic model as well as a political transition to a more open society.I'm betting China will pull it off, but I don't think the world appreciates the risks and challenges ahead.Op-Ed ColumnistWith China's trade surplus with the United States soaring, the tendency in the U.S. will be to react with tariffs and other barriers. But instead we should take a page from the Chinese book and respond by boosting education.One reason China is likely to overtake the U.S. as the world's most important country in this century is that China puts more effort into building human capital than we do.This area in southern Guangdong Province is my wife's ancestral hometown. Sheryl's grandparents left villages here because they thought they could find better opportunities for their children in ''Meiguo'' -- ''Beautiful Country,'' as the U.S. is called in Chinese. And they did. At Sheryl's family reunions, you feel inadequate without a doctorate.But that educational gap between China and America is shrinking rapidly. I visited several elementary and middle schools accompanied by two of my children. And in general, the level of math taught even in peasant schools is similar to that in my kids' own excellent schools in the New York area.My kids' school system doesn't offer foreign languages until the seventh grade. These Chinese peasants begin English studies in either first grade or third grade, depending on the school.Frankly, my daughter got tired of being dragged around schools and having teachers look patronizingly at her schoolbooks and say, ''Oh, we do that two grades younger.''There are, I think, four reasons why Chinese students do so well.First, Chinese students are hungry for education and advancement and work harder. In contrast, U.S. children average 900 hours a year in class and 1,023 hours in front of a television.Here in Sheryl's ancestral village, the students show up at school at about 6:30 a.m. to get extra tutoring before classes start at 7:30. They go home for a lunch break at 11:20 and then are back at school from 2 p.m. until 5. They do homework every night and weekend, and an hour or two of homework each day during their eight-week summer vacation.The second reason is that China has an enormous cultural respect for education, part of its Confucian legacy, so governments and families alike pour resources into education. Teachers are respected and compensated far better, financially and emotionally, in China than in America.In my last column, I wrote about the boomtown of Dongguan, which had no colleges when I first visited it 20 years ago. The town devotes 21 percent of its budget to education, and it now has four universities. An astonishing 58 percent of the residents age 18 to 22 are enrolled in a university.A third reason is that Chinese believe that those who get the best grades are the hardest workers. In contrast, Americans say in polls that the best students are the ones who are innately the smartest. The upshot is that Chinese kids never have an excuse for mediocrity.Chinese education has its own problems, including bribes and fees to get into good schools, huge classes of 50 or 60 students, second-rate equipment and lousy universities. But the progress in the last quarter-century is breathtaking.It's also encouraging that so many Chinese will shake their heads over this column and say it really isn't so. They will complain that Chinese schools teach rote memorization but not creativity or love of learning. That kind of debate is good for the schools and has already led to improvements in English instruction, so that urban Chinese students can communicate better in English than Japanese or South Koreans.After I visited Sheryl's ancestral village, I posted a video of it on the Times Web site. Soon I was astonished to see an excited posting on my blog from a woman who used to live in that village.Litao Mai, probably one of my distant in-laws, grew up in a house she could see on my video. Her parents had only a third grade education, but she became the first person in the village to go to college. She now works for Merrill Lynch in New York and describes herself as ''a little peasant girl'' transformed into ''a capitalist on Wall Street.''That is the magic of education, and there are 1.3 billion more behind Ms. Mai.So let's not respond to China's surpluses by putting up trade barriers. Rather, let's do as we did after the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957: raise our own education standards to meet the competition.Op-Ed ColumnistEvery evening in a little village near this coastal city, peasants gather in a private home and do something that used to be dangerous. They pray.They are Christians gathering in a little ''house church,'' reflecting a religious boom across China. But their story also underscores another trend: the way the legal system here offers hope of chipping away at the Communist Party dictatorship.The tale begins a year ago when the authorities here in Shandong Province raided this house church and carted 31 Christians off to the police station. Such crackdowns are the traditional way the Communist Party has dealt with house churches in rural areas, and some Christians have even been tortured to death.But this incident ended differently.Tian Yinghua, a 55-year-old evangelical Protestant who runs the church in her living room, was outraged after she was ordered jailed for 10 days.''We had done nothing wrong at all,'' explained Ms. Tian. ''We weren't criminals.''So Ms. Tian contacted a prominent Christian and legal scholar in Beijing, Li Baiguang, who traveled to Shandong Province to do something that once would have been unthinkable: Sue the police.Even more unthinkable, Ms. Tian won. The police settled the case by withdrawing the charges. The police also formally apologized, paid symbolic damages of 1 yuan (a bit more than a dime) and promised not to bother the church again.It was a historic victory for freedom of religion in China -- and, even more important, for the rule of law.''The police don't bother us at all,'' said another church leader, Wang Qiu. ''They just stay away.''That seems to be a growing pattern. The central government's policy toward religion is much more relaxed than a few years ago, and in coastal areas the government usually lets people worship freely.''In most places, it's no problem today,'' said Mr. Li, who himself was imprisoned for more than a month two years ago for his legal activism. ''It's just a problem in backward areas, or if you directly attack the Communist Party.''Mr. Li, who enjoys a bit of protection because President Bush invited him to the White House last year, says that last year he filed suits like this one in eight provinces. The other he lost, but even in those cases the authorities were shaken enough that they have stopped harassing Christians, he says.''On the surface we lost,'' he said. ''But in reality, we won in every case.''Han Dongfang, a Chinese labor activist now exiled to Hong Kong, says that he has also found that suing the authorities is often an effective way to increase labor protections. Mr. Han was a leader in the Tiananmen protests of 1989, but now he is trying to bring about change from within. ''I believe this is the way to develop a civil society, not through a revolution,'' he said.Of course, the legal system is still routinely used to oppress people, rather than to protect them. China imprisons more journalists than any country in the world, and one of them is my Times colleague Zhao Yan. Judges never go against the Communist Party; what they can do is rectify local injustices where the higher party officials are indifferent.Moreover, even when lawsuits are allowed to go forward, many Chinese police and judges are so corrupt that they sell themselves to the highest bidder.A common saying, which I even saw in an illegal poster pasted on a government building in Beijing, goes: ''The bandits used to hide in the hills. Now the bandits are in the courthouses.''Still, the rule of law has gained immensely since the 1980's, when a defense attorney was imprisoned for having the temerity to claim that the police had arrested the wrong man and that his client was innocent. If the Chinese government continues to nurture the rule of law, China could increasingly follow the path of South Korea and Taiwan away from autocracy toward greater democracy.Easing the repression could also change the religious complexion of China. Estimates of the number of Chinese Christians vary widely, but the number may be approaching 100 million, many of them evangelical Protestants who aggressively recruit new believers. And with the more relaxed policy, the numbers are soaring.''In 20 to 30 years China will have several hundred million believers,'' said Mr. Li, the lawyer who helped the Shandong church. ''That will make China the biggest Christian nation in the world, with more Christians than the entire U.S. population.''Op-Ed ColumnistIn an archipelago of safe houses here, part of a 21st-century Underground Railroad, I met groups of people who live every moment with sickening fear.These are North Koreans who have escaped to the ''free world'' -- China -- and are now at constant risk of being captured by Chinese police. The Chinese government, in a disgraceful breach of its obligations under the 1951 Refugees Convention, hands these escapees back to North Korea, where they face beatings and imprisonment, occasionally even execution.In one shelter is a 14-year-old North Korean girl: shy, sweet and terrified. Her parents led her across the frozen Tumen River from North Korea in the middle of winter, but then they became separated while trying to flee the police. ''I don't know where my parents are, or if they are even alive,'' she said.Now a joint crackdown by the North Koreans and Chinese is greatly increasing the peril for people like her.The North Korean authorities used to detain citizens returned by China for a few weeks or months and then release them after a bit of ''re-education.'' But about a year ago, North Korea greatly increased the penalties.Now those returned by China are often sentenced to prison for several years, and repeat offenders or Christians can be sent with their entire families to labor camps for life.Some North Koreans told me that their government now holds regular sentencing rallies, at which the punishments are publicly announced -- or in extreme cases, such as those who became Christian evangelists while in China, the accused are executed in front of the crowd by firing squad.One Christian I spoke to had been beaten so badly after his return by China that he tried to commit suicide by swallowing a handful of pins. The prison, not wanting to have to dispose of a corpse, freed him -- and he eventually made his way back to China.''If he is sent back again,'' said his wife, ''he'll be beaten to death.''China has also increased its punishments for its own citizens who are caught helping North Koreans. The penalty used to be a fine, but now it is jail for a year or two -- or for a decade or more if someone smuggles escapees to South Korea.''Now most Chinese don't dare help the Koreans,'' said one local official who secretly protects a safe house full of North Koreans -- and who even stood guard outside as I interviewed them. ''But I feel so badly for them. They're just wretched.''With the help of incredibly courageous conductors on the modern Underground Railroad, I visited four shelters that together house dozens of North Koreans, and residents of a fifth shelter were brought to my vehicle so that I could talk to them safely. My entire visit was conducted under very tight security to make sure I did not lead police to the safe houses.The North Koreans I talked to described a society that is increasingly corrupt and disillusioned. One said that even with the latest crackdown, a $400 bribe to guards will win a prisoner's immediate release. Another estimated that up to 20 percent of North Koreans in her area are disaffected enough that they listen illegally to Chinese broadcasts.Chinese and South Korean missionaries are also beginning to evangelize secretly in North Korea, a sign of weakening government control. One Chinese Christian I talked to had made four trips into North Korea to evangelize. ''If I'd been caught, I don't think I would have been executed,'' she said, ''but it wouldn't have been good.''All the same, none of these North Koreans thought an uprising was imminent. Indeed, a surprising number of them are so steeped in propaganda that they still insist that ''Dear Leader'' Kim Jong-il is a good man. ''The problem is with lower officials, not with Kim Jong-il himself,'' claimed one man who has arranged for smugglers to bring his entire family out to freedom in China. (For more on the North Koreans, go to my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground.)President Bush should raise China's breach of its international obligations with Hu Jintao. Mr. Bush might think of that 14-year-old girl, who spends her days minding two 9-year-old boys whose mothers were caught and sent back to North Korea. Those three children are modern reminders of the terrors of Anne Frank. They fear with every footstep outside their door that China will arrest them and send them back to their national torture chamber.Op-Ed ColumnistI'd meant to focus this column on a Chinese woman whose battle for justice has led the police to arrest her more than 30 times, lock her in an insane asylum, humiliate her sexually, shock her with cattle prods, beat her until she is crippled and, worst of all, take away her young daughter.The case of Li Guirong, a graying 50-year-old who now hobbles on crutches, reflects China at its worst -- government by thuggery. But each time I start this column, I feel that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have pulled the rug out from under me. Do I really have the right to complain about torture or extra-legal detentions in China when we Americans do the same in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba?I keep remembering a heated conversation I had in Yunnan Province when I lived in China years ago. I reproached an official for China's torture and arbitrary imprisonment, and he retorted that China was fragile and had lost hundreds of thousands of lives in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. ''If you Americans ever faced the threat of chaos, you would do just the same,'' he said.''Impossible!'' I replied.Yet I owe him an apology, for he has been proven right. The moment we did feel a threat, after 9/11, we held people without trial, and beatings were widespread enough that more than 110 of our prisoners died in custody in places like Abu Ghraib, Bagram and Guantánamo.Our extrajudicial detentions and mistreatment of prisoners are wrong in and of themselves. But they also undercut our own ability to speak against oppression and torture around the world.If I protest here about the abuse of Ms. Li, Chinese officials will simply say that we Americans are hypocrites who should clean up our own house before we go around pointing fingers. But let me protest anyway.Ms. Li's story began in 1994, when her husband was badly injured in a fall in the state-owned coal mine where they both worked. Rather than pay medical care and disability, the mine fired him.Ms. Li protested to local officials -- and then the mine fired her as well. So she made a series of trips to Beijing to appeal for help from the central government -- but each time the police just rounded her up and sent her back to her native Jilin Province.Twice the local police sentenced her to a labor camp. The first time, she was imprisoned for a year for trying to tell her story to a British journalist. The second time, she was imprisoned for 18 months for escalating her protests and trying to contact government leaders.Local officials once had her stripped naked in front of male police officers and strapped down to a bed in a mental hospital, where they gave her injections of drugs that for a time left her in a stupor.Another time, she was beaten and kicked so badly that she is still unable to walk without crutches. But the worst outrage, she says, is the targeting of her children.The authorities threatened to deny her eldest daughter, Wang Lingli, a place in university, although in the end she scored so brilliantly on her college entrance exams that the officials backed off. Ms. Wang, who confirms her mother's story, is now looking after her severely disabled father and is about to graduate from university -- but only if she can pay $2,850 she still owes in college fees.As for the younger daughter, now 12, the authorities carted her off to an orphanage. That just breaks Ms. Li's heart. I brought two of my own children when I interviewed Ms. Li, and she told me how much she missed her own little girl as she held my daughter and wept and wept.The United States must stand up against such human rights abuses around the world -- and our first step should be to clean up our act.Our own equivalent of Ms. Li is Sami al-Hajj, a cameraman for Al Jazeera who has been held in Guantánamo for more than five years. He still suffers from painful injuries that he apparently received in beatings while in American custody.The U.S. government has never offered a hint of evidence that he is anything but a journalist. Indeed, Mr. Hajj's lawyers say that the interrogators have offered to release him immediately if he will spy on Al Jazeera.So, Mr. Bush, give prisoners like Mr. Hajj their rights -- and give America back its moral authority to speak up for human rights around the world.Op-Ed ColumnistLast month I invited readers to send in poems for my second Iraq Poetry Contest.More than 500 poems poured in, and one of those that moved me most was from Frances Richey of New York City. Her son, Ben, had been deployed in Iraq. Ben always sent a gift for Mother's Day, but this time nothing arrived and he was unreachable.''I was terrified,'' she told me, and she wrote a poem about what happened:Last Mother's Day, whenhe was incommunicado,nothing came.Three days later, a messagein my box; a package,the mail room closed.I went out into the lobby,banged my fist againstthe desk. When theygave it to me, I clutched itto my chest, sobbinglike an animal.I spoke to no one,did not apologizeSusan Donnelly, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and has written several books of poetry, wrote this poem after seeing photos from Iraq:These figures stand the way wehumans do always:one covering his face,another looking to heaven.But it is the gesture of the third,perhaps a brother,who has placed his open palm,protective, firm,on the chest of a dead manthere you can go nowthat makes me, miles awayand in the wrong country,cover my face with my hands.In April, The Times published an article about Sam Ross, who had been welcomed as a hero in his Appalachian town when he returned blinded and disabled from the war -- but whose life then spiraled downward and out of control, leaving him in prison and then a psychiatric hospital. Gordon Fain, a U.C.L.A. professor, wrote a ballad about him:Just a coin toss,Heads it was someone else, tails it was RossA volunteerWho went to Iraq, was helping to clearMines to a pitThen heard a discharge, felt the metal hitHis legs and face,The fragments finding every open placeOf flesh and bone;And when he woke, he lay in bed aloneAmazed to findThat he had one leg cut off and was blind.The whole town madeSam Ross a hero: bagpipes, a paradeA home they setOn top of a hill, but he could not forgetInsistent dreamsOf floating, in which his whole body seemsIn peaceful flightTo burst apart in searing flames of lightSo he beganTo drink, and young men took him in a vanFrom his house, downTo every bar and strip club within town.Then a fourth-grade student in the South Bronx, Raphael Sosa, submitted this:I feel sad.my friends are angry;I'm scared.how did my father die?who killed him?my father has died.the tv tells me we wonbut my father died.my father is dead.A lump in my throat, I checked with Raphael's teacher. He assured me that the poem was only a product of the boy's imagination.These excerpts don't do the poems justice -- please read the full versions on my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground.Throughout history, the most memorable accounts of war -- from Homer to Wilfred Owen -- haven't been journalistic or historical, but poetic. For whatever reason, the ugliest of human pursuits generates some of the most beautiful human handiwork.So let's add these poems, as one more monument to the folly of this war -- and one more memorial to those who will never rejoin their families.Op-Ed ColumnistSpeciose Kabagwira lost another baby last week. It was the end of her 12th pregnancy, and the infant was stillborn on delivery.It was her fifth stillbirth or miscarriage. And of her seven children born alive, four have died.At one level, what killed her children and cost her those pregnancies was a combination of poverty and pathetic health care. But hovering in the background is another of Africa's great killers: civil conflict and instability.Earlier this year, I held a ''win-a-trip contest'' to choose a student and a teacher to take with me on a reporting trip to Africa. Now I'm taking the winners to the Great Lakes region here in Central Africa partly because it underscores the vast human cost when we in the West allow conflicts to fester in forgotten parts of the world.On our two-week trip, the winners -- Leana Wen, a medical student from Washington University, and Will Okun, a high school teacher in Chicago -- will travel with me through Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. (Will and Leana are blogging and video blogging at www.nytimes.com/twofortheroad.)Since the Rwandan genocide began in 1994, at least five million people have died in the Great Lakes region in what is sometimes called Africa's first world war. In the Congo, those deaths are still piling up.Leana, Will and I visited the Catholic church yesterday in Nyamata, in Southern Rwanda, where hundreds and hundreds of terrified Tutsis were butchered in 1994 after they took shelter there.Most numbing are the bloodstains on one section in the back of the church. That is where the attackers gathered babies and bashed them against the wall. Below the church is a crypt with endless rows of skulls and other bones of the victims -- a monument to the shameful refusal of Western powers to get involved in African genocides.The Rwandan bloodbath was over quickly, and Rwanda is now peaceful and booming, but the turmoil is still enveloping families like Ms. Kabagwira's. We found her in an encampment of 2,000 Rwandans, all of whom who had fled tribal violence to Tanzania -- but who were driven back last year by rampaging Tanzanians.Now Ms. Kabagwira is living in a makeshift hut, in an area where water is inadequate, soil is poor and the nearest hospital is a one-hour bus ride away. She says she might have been able to save her baby last week if she had gone to the hospital earlier, but she couldn't pay the $1.20 bus fare.So how do we help people like Ms. Kabagwira? Some excellent answers are found in the best book on international affairs so far this year: Paul Collier's ''The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It.''Mr. Collier, a former research director of the World Bank, notes that when the G-8 countries talk about helping Africa, they overwhelmingly focus just on foreign aid. Sure, aid has a role to play, but it's pointless to build clinics when rebel groups are running around burning towns and shooting doctors.One essential kind of help that the West can provide -- but one that is rarely talked about -- is Western military assistance in squashing rebellions, genocides and civil wars, or in protecting good governments from insurrections. The average civil war costs $64 billion, yet could often be suppressed in its early stages for very modest sums. The British military intervention in Sierra Leone easily ended a savage war and was enthusiastically welcomed by local people -- and, as a financial investment, achieved benefits worth 30 times the cost.Josh Ruxin, a Columbia University public health expert living in Rwanda, notes that a modest Western force could have stopped the genocide in 1994 -- or, afterward, rooted out Hutu extremists who fled to Congo and dragged that country into a civil war that has cost millions of lives.''Had an international force come in and rounded them up, that would have been the biggest life-saving measure in modern history,'' he said.So it's time for the G-8 countries to conceive of foreign aid more broadly -- not just to build hospitals and schools, but also to work with the African Union to provide security in areas that have been ravaged by rebellion and war. A starting point would be a serious effort to confront genocide in Darfur -- and at least an international force to prop up Chad and Central African Republic, rather than allow Africa to tumble into its second world war.Op-Ed ColumnistOne hint that this would be an unusual interview came when the warlord walked in wearing a button reading ''Rebels For Christ.''Then when I reached to sip the café au lait that the guerrilla leaders offered me in their jungle redoubt, they looked reproachful and quickly bowed their heads and said grace.I'm taking a student and a teacher along on a reporting trip to Africa, and we wanted to look at how civil wars tear countries apart and block the continent's economic development. So we rented a jeep and drove past the last checkpoints outside the city of Goma, and then jounced along a tortuous dirt road into the hills.We traveled through gorgeous green hills and forests, thatch-roof villages and mist-shrouded canyons. Government is only a rumor here, for the capital is 1,200 miles away and has no control in the east and offers no services. There is no postal service, no national health or education system, no authority to rein in the ultimate boss in the third world: a man with a gun.Along the way to see the warlord, we stopped at an elementary school. It is financed by the parents, who pay $9 per year per child to the eight teachers who instruct 520 students. Many parents cannot afford that sum, so they keep their children at home.The school building hadn't been kept up since the Belgians ruled Congo in the years before 1960. The Belgians were brutal colonial masters in Congo, but after enduring subsequent rounds of kleptocratic incompetence and civil war, some Congolese feel nostalgic for the lesser tyranny of colonialism.Finally we were stopped by a band of soldiers who searched us carefully and then led us past more guards with AK-47s and grenade launchers to the sanctum of Laurent Nkunda, the chieftain of a swath of war-torn eastern Congo.Mr. Nkunda, 40, is a smart and charismatic man with a university education who treated us to several hours of lively conversation in his fluent English, followed by a tasty chicken dinner. He described himself as a devout Pentecostal and said that most of his troops had converted as well; he showed us a church where he said they pray daily, and he showed photos of baptisms of the soldiers.Then again, the government has issued an international arrest warrant against him for war crimes, and human rights monitors like Refugees International say that his troops have killed and raped civilians and pillaged their villages. He denies the charges.''I'm not a warlord  I'm a liberator of the people,'' he said.That's the problem: So are they all.More than four million people have died in Congo's wars since 1998, making it the most lethal conflict since World War II.Probably no slaughter has gotten fewer column inches -- or fewer television minutes -- per million deaths. So even after all that suffering, Congo still hasn't risen to a prominent place on the international agenda.That's why I came here with Leana Wen and Will Okun, the student and teacher from my win-a-trip contest. (Video and photos of the trip and blogs by Will and Leana are at nytimes.com/twofortheroad.)The U.N. did hold elections last year, and much of Congo is indeed more stable today. But here in this region of eastern Congo, a wretched situation is getting even worse.Since January about 150,000 people have been driven from their homes by renewed violence, and there are widespread fears that a larger war is looming.''We see war coming,'' Mr. Nkunda said, and he pulled out his laptop to show a map indicating that various government-backed forces are being dispatched to attack him. He added: ''The only reply to war and ammunition is war and ammunition.''I told him -- a bit nervously -- that such tribalism and fighting has torn apart a country that should be one of Africa's richest. But Mr. Nkunda, who quotes Gandhi, emphasized that what counts here is simply force. ''You go by strength,'' he said.There are no easy solutions here, although some steps are essential: supporting professional training and reform of the Congolese security forces, pressuring neighboring Rwanda to support central authority over the full country, bolstering the peace process, and interdicting mineral exports that finance rebel armies. But the most important step is simply for the international community to acknowledge that a war that costs four million lives must be an international priority, even if the victims aren't staring at us from television screens.Op-Ed Columnist
