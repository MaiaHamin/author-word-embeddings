It was a scene that Mary McCarthy could have written the devil out of: a funeral for a fine, bland fellow that filled everybody with unfine, unbland thoughts. The formal serenity of the service, disguised, but only barely, the virulent rivalries and envies and grudges and grievances that have roiled this group for many decades.None of the eulogists noted the irony that the man who ushered out one long national nightmare had ushered in another, the one we're living in now. It was Gerald Ford, after all, who gave America the gift of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld -- the gift that keeps on taking.The two former Ford administration officials, who doomed Iraq to civil war and despoiled American values, were honorary pallbearers yesterday, as was that other slippery and solipsistic courtier, Henry Kissinger.The group was even more on edge because of a remarkable trellis of peppery opinions that had tumbled out of the man in the coffin, posthumously. The late president, hailed as the most understated and decent guy in the world, had given a series of interviews on the condition that they be held until his death -- a belated but bracing smackdown of many of his distinguished mourners.It was impossible not to wonder what the luminaries were truly thinking, as they sat listening to fugues of Bach and Brahms and encomiums to the ordinary-guy leader.Nancy Reagan's imperturbable expression behind her big sunglasses did not disguise the gloating words visible in the bubble over her head: ''And they call this a funeral?''It could not compare, of course, to the incredible Princess of Wales treatment that her husband had for his state funeral. And Nancy, hypersensitive to any slights to her Ronnie, would not have been pleased with Mr. Ford's interview with Michael Beschloss published in Newsweek, in which he blamed Ronald Reagan for costing him the 1976 election by challenging his nomination and then failing to hit the trail for him.It was good of Mr. Ford to bring 41 and 43 together in a solemn respite from their uneasy competition over Iraq.''Told you so, you sons of guns -- we were right to stop at Safwan and stay out of Baghdad,'' the father's bubble read, as he watched Rummy and Henry the K, both of whom had treated Poppy with such veiled contempt, as though he were a feather duster. ''Those vicious Moktada-loving Shiites dancing around Saddam's dead body prove that Brent and I were right.''Lynne Cheney glared at Poppy as he gave his eulogy, knowing that he privately thinks that the vice president has destroyed not only Iraq and American foreign policy, but the Bush family name. Her storm cloud of a bubble is expurgated.Hillary's bubble was full of mockery for another New Yorker in the National Cathedral: ''You think you're so smart, Rudy, but you leave your entire presidential battle plan in a hotel room for your rivals to find? The victim role doesn't suit you.'' Condi's bubble was as opaquely dark as Hillary's was risibly light -- drooping with the inchoate fear that her nearby erstwhile mentor, Brent Scowcroft, had been right about Iraq after all.As Poppy spoke from the altar, praising Mr. Ford's generosity, he must have been mulling that his predecessor was ungenerous in spitting on him from the grave. Mr. Ford told Mr. Beschloss that Bush Senior had sold out the party to the hard right and had taken a phony, pandering position on abortion.Poppy had to have enjoyed watching Dr. K get up and lavish praise on his old boss, after Mr. Ford had sniggered to Bob Woodward that the ''coy'' Bavarian diva had ''the thinnest skin of any public figure I ever knew.''W. graciously walked Betty Ford down the aisle, even as he must have curdled inside about her husband's telling Mr. Woodward that it had been ''a big mistake'' on the part of W., Dick Cheney and Rummy to justify the Iraq war with nonexistent W.M.D. ''I just don't think we should go hellfire damnation around the globe freeing people, unless it is directly related to our own national security,'' he said.Ex-presidents weren't supposed to criticize sitting presidents. Adding insult to injury, Woodward himself was in the cathedral. How did he manage to get all these deathbed confessions, W. had to wonder. ''Jeez,'' his bubble read, ''does he have an interview with my old man in the can?''Rummy's pop-up was as cocky as ever: ''Golly, I've been gone three weeks and things are really looking up in Iraq.''James Baker's secret thoughts belied his poker face: ''I tried to help you out, son, but you're too dang stubborn. Or 'resolute,' as you say. Stubolute. A clear case of TMC -- too much Cheney.''Dick Cheney's bubble was trouble: ''I'm surging, I'm surging, I'm surging.''Op-Ed ColumnistThere was a touch of parody to the giddy Democrat takeover this week: Nancy Pelosi indulging her inner Haight-Ashbury and dipping the Capitol in tie-dye, sashaying around with the Grateful Dead, Wyclef Jean, Carole King, Richard Gere, feminists and a swarm of well-connected urchins.The first act of House Democrats who promised to govern with bipartisan comity was imperiously banishing Republicans from participating in the initial round of lawmaking. Even if Republicans were brutes during their reign, Democrats should have shown more class, letting the whiny minority party offer some stupid amendments that would lose.Perhaps the Democrats' power-shift into overdrive is a neurological disorder, or neuropolitical disorder.If free will is an illusion -- if we are, as one philosopher put it, ''nothing more than sophisticated meat machines,'' doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over -- that would explain a lot about the latest trend in which everyone is reverting to type.William James wrote in 1890 that the whole ''sting and excitement'' of life comes from ''our sense that in it things are really being decided from one moment to another, and that it is not the dull rattling off of a chain that was forged innumerable ages ago.''But in Science Times this week, Dennis Overbye advised Dr. James to ''get over it,'' observing that ''a bevy of experiments in recent years suggest that the conscious mind is like a monkey riding a tiger of subconscious decisions and actions in progress, frantically making up stories about being in control.''As Mark Hallett of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke told Mr. Overbye, ''Free will does exist, but it's a perception, not a power or a driving force.  The more you scrutinize it, the more you realize you don't have it.''That would explain why, after voters insisted that the president wrap it up in Iraq, he made a big show of pretending to listen, then decided to do a war do-over.Is this just the baked-in stubbornness of one man, or is W.'s behavior evidence that he has no free will? Is the Decider freely choosing another huge blunder or is he taking instructions from his genetic and political coding, fearing that if he admits what a foul hash he's made of Iraq, he'll be labeled a wimp, as his dad was?If W. is trapped on a tiger, he's not the only one.John McCain can't get beyond seeing himself as a maverick now that he's become a nonmaverick, a right-wing Republican urging an escalation of a hopeless war, even though he's already lived through an escalation of a hopeless war.''There are two keys to any surge in U.S. troops,'' Senator McCain told an appreciative audience at the American Enterprise Institute yesterday. ''It must be substantial, and it must be sustained.''With the letter she and Harry Reid wrote to the president yesterday, warning him that ''we are well past the point of more troops for Iraq,'' Speaker Pelosi tried to exert her free will to stop the Surge. But the Democrats aren't willing to take real action and cut off money for the Surge. They're predetermined to want to have it both ways: not to be blamed for the war and not to be blamed for pulling the plug on the war.Iraq has become a snake pit of factions failing to escape fate. Shiites and Sunnis have been fighting and killing each other for about 1,400 years over who was the rightful heir to Muhammad, and yet the entire American high command was somehow taken aback that Shiites and Sunnis can't muster the free will to keep their country from disintegrating.Could it have been kismet that there were Shiites taunting Saddam at his hanging? Maybe it was preordained back in the days when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and the British diplomat Gertrude Bell drew the boundaries of the modern Iraq that a security guy with a cellphone would capture the spectacle.Despite all the talk back in the 2000 campaign about a robustly experienced foreign-policy dream team, it may have been destined that the Bush administration would be asleep in the run-up to the insurgency, just as it was asleep in the run-up to 9/11, to Katrina, to the occupation and to the refugee crisis in Iraq. Either all that was predetermined, or the administration was preternaturally negligent.Arthur Schopenhauer, the German philosopher who said a man can do what he wants but cannot will what he wants, would have understood W.'s nonsensical urge to Surge.We don't know if human beings have free will. We just know that human beings in Washington appear not to.Op-Ed ColumnistIt isn't really a romance turned sour, because it was never sweet.The American military's cocky heroes were supposed to sweep in and carry off a poor, grateful Iraq to security and bliss, like Richard Gere did Debra Winger in the finale of ''An Officer and a Gentleman.'' The strategy was: Love lift us up where we belong/Where the eagles cry/On a mountain high.Didn't happen. Yet the search goes on, in this country obsessed with hookups and breakups, for the right relationship metaphor to describe our deadly embrace of Iraq.My colleague Tom Friedman wrote last week: ''Whenever I hear this surge idea, I think of a couple who recently got married but the marriage was never very solid. Then one day they say to each other, 'Hey, let's have a baby, that will bring us together.' It never works. If the underlying union is not there, adding a baby won't help.''Juan Williams repeated Tom's metaphor on Fox News, agreeing that ''a bad relationship'' cannot afford the ''pressure'' of a newborn.One reporter who writes about the war told me he thinks of the American entrenchment in Iraq more like a marriage that's run out of gas, but you decide to stay together because of the kids.Bill Maher used a bawdier metaphor of a man who promises his date a glorious romp, doesn't deliver, and then just refuses to admit it and get out.Some women say that the Surge will not work because it's like starting over with an old boyfriend: you think you've learned the pitfalls and can resume with more success -- you can set benchmarks! -- but instead you're swiftly ensnared by the same old failures. And the most maddening romances, of course, are those in which you think you have the power, you should have the power, but somehow in the end, you don't have the power.Many Bush officials and lawmakers now talk about the Iraqis with impatience, as though they are deadbeat relatives who have got to stop putting the pinch on us for a billion a week and try harder, in the immortal words of Rummy, ''to pull up their socks.''They may still speak diplomatically, but in body language, Condoleezza Rice and her chosen new deputy, John Negroponte, radiate irritation with the Iraqis, as though they are the most irksome of cousins or in-laws who have long overstayed their welcome, or children who not only don't thank you for presents but also leave the playroom a mess.The favorite analogy of Rummy and others who pushed the war was parent-child. ''If you never take the training wheels off a kid's bicycle,'' Paul Wolfowitz would say, ''he'll never learn to ride without them.''But that is too Norman Rockwell for a scene straight out of Hieronymus Bosch.At times, the American-Iraqi relationship seems so cursed that the most apt metaphor would be a fairy tale like ''The Golden Goose'' of the Brothers Grimm, in which a girl sees a bling bird that belongs to a despised boy and tries to pluck a feather for herself, but instead her hand gets stuck fast to the goose. Her sister comes along, thinking she can snatch a feather, but she gets stuck as soon as she touches the first girl. Then there's a Surge, when the third sister rushes to help but ends up stuck in a daisy chain of disaster.With the Surge, as with the invasion of Iraq, W. is like the presumptuous date ''who reserves a hotel room and then asks you to the prom,'' as my friend Dana Calvo put it.Teddy Kennedy gave a speech at the National Press Club yesterday about his new legislation that would require Congressional approval before troop levels can be increased. Afterward, he was asked if he would try to block the escalation with an amendment to an upcoming Iraq spending request.''The horse will be out of the barn by the time we get there,'' Senator Kennedy replied. ''The president makes his speech now. We're going to get the appropriation request probably the end of January, early February.'' He said it could take eight more weeks for Congress to act. ''By that time, the troops will already be there,'' he said. ''And then we'll be asked, are we going to deny the body armor to the young men and women over there?''In other words, the president will ask us to the prom once he reserves the hotel room.Op-Ed ColumnistI feel good about the new war with Iran.How can you not have confidence in the crackerjack team that brought you Operation Iraqi Freedom, which foundered and led to Operation Together Forward, which stumbled and led to Operation Together Forward II, which collapsed and was replaced by The New Way Forward, the Surge now being launched even though nobody's together and everything's going backward?I say, bring it on. If a pre-emptive war in Iraq doesn't work, why not try a pre-emptive war on Iran in Iraq?Although Tony Snow dismissed the idea of war with Iran as an ''urban legend'' yesterday, Condi Rice revealed to New York Times reporters that President Bush acted months ago to parry Iran's ambitions, issuing orders for a military campaign against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces sneaking into Iraq. Using diplomatic passports, the agents have been smuggling in sophisticated bomb-making components and infrared trigger devices, which could be used to blow up American soldiers.The move against Iran allows the president and Dick Cheney -- who was, natch, militating for the Surge -- to blow off, once more, the Iraq Study Group and Congress, to push back rather than make up.James Baker and Lee Hamilton had recommended playing nice with the mad mullahs, which even they acknowledged was a long shot, given that the Bush administration can offer them little except acquiescence in their nuclear weapons program, which is not going to happen.Joe Biden, the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned Condi on Thursday that Mr. Bush did not have the authority to pursue the networks over the border into Iran or Syria. On Friday, Bob Gates assured the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Iranians they target won't be in Iran.We're trying to stanch a self-inflicted wound: our failed occupation gave Iran the opening in Iraq we're now trying to shut down.The White House had to admit this week what has been obvious to everybody else for eons, including a list of lame assumptions they embraced during the first few years of the occupation: ''Majority of Iraqis will support the coalition and Iraqi efforts to build a democratic state'' has now been supplanted by ''Iraqis increasingly disillusioned with coalition efforts.''It's a remarkable moment, W. standing nearly alone, deserted by more and more Republicans, generals and Americans, risking it all on a weak reed like Prime Minister Maliki.It's impossible to know what W. was really thinking as he stiffly delivered his fantasy scheme in the White House library. The whole capital was fraught, but the president may simply have been musing to himself: ''I'm hungry  I wonder what time the game starts on ESPN? Has anybody read all these books?''W. always acts like he's upping the ante in a board game where you roll the dice and bet your plastic army divisions on the outcome. This doesn't surprise some of his old classmates at Yale, who remember Junior as the riskiest Risk player of them all, known for dropping by the rooms of friends , especially when they were trying to study for exams, for extended bouts of ''The Game of Global Domination.''Junior was known as an extremely aggressive player in the venerable Parker Brothers board game, a brutal contest that requires bluster and bluffing as you invade countries, all the while betraying alliances. Notably, it's almost impossible to win Risk and conquer the world if you start the game in the Middle East, because you're surrounded by enemies.His gamesmanship extended to sports -- he loved going into overtime and demanding that points be played over because he wasn't quite ready.As Graydon Carter recollects in the new Vanity Fair, Gail Sheehy wrote an article for the magazine about W. that made this point: ''Even if he loses, his friends say, he doesn't lose. He'll just change the score, or change the rules, or make his opponent play until he can beat him.''W.'s best friend when he was a teenager in Houston, Doug Hannah, told Ms. Sheehy: ''If you were playing basketball and you were playing to 11 and he was down, you went to 15.''Even if it was clear who was winning, W. wanted to go further to see what would happen. It was a technique that worked well in Tallahassee in 2000, but not so well in Tikrit.Word is that even as they Surge, the Bush team is already working on Plan C, or as they will no doubt call it, The New, New Way Forward II.Op-Ed ColumnistBeing president can be really, really hard.''Sometimes you're the commander in chief,'' W. explained to Scott Pelley on ''60 Minutes.'' ''Sometimes you're the educator in chief, and a lot of times you're both when it comes to war.''President Bush has been dutifully making the rounds of TV news shows, trying to make the case that victory in Iraq is ''doable.'' He thinks the public will support the Surge if he can simply illuminate a few things that we may have been too thick to understand. For instance, he says he needs to ''explain to people that what happens in the Middle East will affect the future of this country.'' Yes, Mr. President, we get it.He also told Jim Lehrer last night that in 20 years, radical Shiites could be warring with radical Sunnis and Middle Eastern oil could fall into the hands of radicals, who might also get weapons of mass destruction.So after scaring Americans into backing the Sack of Iraq by warning that radicals could get W.M.D., now he's trying to scare Americans into supporting the Surge in Iraq by warning that radicals could get W.M.D.So many deaths, so little progress.It's unnerving to be tutored by an educator in chief who is himself being tutored. The president elucidating the Iraqi insurgency for us is learning about the Algerian insurgency from the man who failed to quell the Vietcong insurgency.During his ''60 Minutes'' interview, Mr. Bush mentioned that he was reading Alistair Horne's classic history, ''A Savage War of Peace,'' about why the French suffered a colonial disaster in a guerrilla war against Muslims in Algiers from 1954 to 1962.The book was recommended to W. by Henry Kissinger, who is working on an official biography of himself with Mr. Horne.Mr. Horne recalled that Dr. Kissinger told him: ''The president's one of my best students. He reads all the books I send him.'' The author asked the president's foreign affairs adviser if W. ever wrote any essays on the books. ''Henry just laughed,'' Mr. Horne said.It seems far too late for Mr. Bush to begin studying about counterinsurgency now that Iraq has cratered into civil war. Can't someone get the president a copy of ''Gone With the Wind''?Maybe it was inevitable, once W. started reading Camus's ''L'Etranger,'' set in Algeria, that he would move on to Mr. Horne. As The Washington Post military correspondent Tom Ricks wrote in November, the Horne book has been an underground best-seller among U.S. military officers for three years, and ''Algeria'' has become almost a code word among counterinsurgency specialists for the mess in Iraq. The Pentagon screened the 1966 movie ''The Battle of Algiers'' in 2003, but the commander in chief must have missed it.I asked Mr. Horne, who was at his home in a small village outside Oxford, England, what the president could learn from his book.''The depressing problem of getting entangled in the Muslim world,'' he replied. ''Algeria was a thoroughly bloodthirsty war that ended horribly and cost the lives of about 20,000 Frenchmen and a million Algerians. There was a terrible civil war. De Gaulle ended up giving literally everything away and left without his pants.''President de Gaulle had all the same misconceptions as W., that his prestige could persuade the Muslims to accept his terms; that the guerrillas would recognize military defeat and accept sensible compromise; and that, as Mr. Horne writes, ''time would wait while he found the correct formula and then imposed peace with it.''Mr. Horne also sees sad parallels in the torture issue: ''The French had experience under the Nazis in the occupation and practiced methods the Germans used in Algeria and extracted information that helped them win the Battle of Algiers. But in the long run it lost the war, because it caused such revulsion in France when the news came out, and there was huge opposition to the war from Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.''In May 2005, Mr. Horne gave a copy of his book to Rummy, with passages about torture underlined. ''I got a savage letter back from him,'' the author said.The best thing now, he said, is to try to ''get around the mullahs'' and ''get non-Christian forces in there as quickly as possible, mercenaries. As Henry said the other day, if only we had two brigades of Gurkhas to send to Baghdad.''Meanwhile, maybe W. should move on to reading Sartre. ''No Exit,'' perhaps.Op-Ed ColumnistGeorge Bush may have lost his swagger, but Harry Flashman hasn't.Maybe the president presiding over a quicksand empire got a vicarious thrill out of the fictional Victorian brigadier general who roamed from Chillianwalla to Isandlwana to Abyssinia at the height of the British Empire, always making conquests in love and war despite his cowardly, caddish behavior.In our continuing odyssey of discovery through the president's reading list, we learned that he perused two of George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman books, ''Flashman at the Charge'' and ''Flash for Freedom.''There are those who are skeptical of the president's souped-up reading list, a result of a book-reading contest with Karl Rove.''I don't think he understands the world,'' Jay Rockefeller, the new chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told The Times's Mark Mazzetti. ''I don't think he's particularly curious about the world. I don't think he reads like he says he does. Every time he's read something he tells you about it.''I just wish W. had read more about the perils of empire before he naïvely dived into one. Mr. Fraser agrees that W. should have read the original ''Flashman'' before invading Afghanistan. It could have given him invaluable, if politically incorrect, insights that might have helped in the effort to catch Osama at Tora Bora and in the new push to stop the Taliban slouching toward Kandahar.On a recent visit to Afghanistan, Robert Gates told nervous military commanders that he was open to sending more troops to thwart the Taliban from regrouping. Congressman John McHugh, who just returned from a trip to Afghanistan with Hillary Clinton and Evan Bayh, said that everyone they talked to had warned ''that when the snows melt in the mountains, it will bring a new onslaught from Al Qaeda and the Taliban one that directly threatens not just the Karzai presidency, but threatens Afghanistan itself, and logically, it follows, threatens our investment in blood and treasure.''''Flashman'' is based on a devastating British defeat during one of their wars in Afghanistan. After invading Kabul in 1839 and setting up an unpopular puppet shah, the British trekked through the snowy mountains to Jalalabad. Of more than 16,000 troops and camp followers, only one doctor survived; the rest were picked off in ambushes by Afghan warriors.The lesson is that Afghanistan is a no man's land that can't be tamed by gringos. The British Empire, on which the sun never set, never succeeded in occupying Afghanistan even as it engaged in the Great Game with the Russians for influence there. It was terra incognita and terra fuggedaboutit.''You could never forget that in Afghanistan you are walking a knife-edge the whole time,'' Harry Flashman notes, adding that, like himself, the Afghans could be ''cruel and bloodthirsty,'' turning on you with no warning.Mr. Fraser echoed those sentiments when I tracked him down at his home on the Isle of Man. ''No one has ever succeeded in invading Afghanistan,'' the octogenarian who fought in Burma in World War II boomed with a trace of Scottish accent.''The Afghans are extraordinary fighters, tough and resourceful and cruel, and they know their business inside out,'' he said. ''On their own territory, they're unbeatable. They love fighting and dealing with invaders. It's almost a game to them. The country is Death Valley 10 times over. You see them on television in their robes with their weapons and that's all. The American and British troops are loaded with rubbishy equipment.''Eventually, I suppose, we'll get out of Iraq and pretend it's been a success when it's just a mess. ''Afghanistan is slightly different. You cannot ever win. When you consider the Russians put in more than 100,000 troops and couldn't do it. There's only one way to deal with the Afghans, and that's to buy them.''Mr. Fraser recites the end of Kipling's ''The Ballad of the King's Mercy'':Abdhur Rahman, the Durani Chief, of him is the story told,He has opened his mouth to the North and the South,They have stuffed his mouthand sweet his favours arefrom Balkh to Kandahar.''It wouldn't do Bush any harm to read Kipling,'' he concluded before signing off.Op-Ed ColumnistMadame Speaker didn't lean over and boink the president on the head with her gavel, or garrote him with her red pashmina.No one was gelded or cuckolded or left to bleed on the floor of the Senate, as in HBO's ''Rome,'' that other gory saga of a declining empire with people who can't stop talking.Still, the nation's capital had the aroma of treachery, as former allies brutally turned on one another. Despite W.'s attempt to salvage his presidency last night by changing the subject and going all domestic-sensitive, Washington was more consumed with betrayal than substance.The city was riveted by opening statements in the Scooter Libby trial, where the aspens were turning but not in clusters. Scooter's lawyer claimed that the White House had made his client a scapegoat in the Valerie Plame case to protect Karl Rove because ''Boy Genius,'' as W. calls him, was critical to keeping the Republican Party in power.In light of the 2006 debacle, the White House might have been better off saving Scooter and making Karl the fall guy.Vice got an extra dose of unflattering limelight in the debut issue of The Politico, a Capitol Hill publication. In an interview with Roger Simon, John McCain stopped pandering to the White House long enough to lambaste Dick Cheney for stirring a ''witch's brew'' of a ''terribly mishandled'' war. What took the brave senator so long?''The president listened too much to the vice president,'' he said, adding, ''Of course, the president bears the ultimate responsibility, but he was very badly served by both the vice president and, most of all, the secretary of defense.''At a critical hearing yesterday, senators happily blew a chance to grill Lt. Gen. David Petraeus, W.'s choice to try to rescue Iraq, on whether those 21,500 additional troops will be cavalry to the rescue or lambs to the slaughter.Why dwell on the most consequential elements of American strategy when they can linger over something even more repercussive: their own political reputations?Hillary Clinton, who dodged a recent important Iraq hearing by flying to Iraq, did not have any questions at all for the general. She simply lectured him crisply on her belated discovery that the administration has a ''dead-end'' and ''blank check'' policy, as she tried to seem like the kind of gal who could command the most powerful military on earth. This is odd from someone who is running infomercials on her Web site promising ''a conversation.''In their questioning, Senator Joe Lieberman and Mr. McCain seemed most interested in enlisting the general's prestige for their own campaign to discredit colleagues in both parties who are tired of passively watching W.'s disaster unfold.If the Senate sends the additional troops but conveys the belief they cannot succeed, Mr. McCain asked, ''what effect does that have on the morale of your troops?''''It would not be a beneficial effect,'' the general replied.Senator Lieberman also asked whether a Senate resolution expressing disapproval of The Surge would give the enemy in Iraq ''encouragement'' that the American people ''were divided.''The general agreed: ''That's correct, sir.''Much of the rest of the hearing was squandered in attempts by Democrats and Republicans who had criticized the war to get the general to back away from his opinion that the troops would be hurt and the enemy emboldened by any impediment that the legislative branch might throw in W.'s way.''Honorable people have different views, and they will voice their criticisms,'' chided John Warner, who presented a bipartisan resolution on Monday declaring that the Senate ''disagrees with the 'plan' to augment our forces.''He told General Petraeus that as President Nixon's secretary of the Navy, he had sat where the general was, justifying another impossible war. ''I hope,'' he warned the witness, ''that this colloquy has not entrapped you into some responses that you might later regret.''The fact that Senator Warner attacked The Surge in a formal way means that a substantial majority of the Senate are willing to stick their necks out. It's the beginning of a slow procession to limit spending on the war and rein in Mr. Bush.As one does in a job interview, the general tried to oblige everyone. After getting caught in a political mine field, he demurred that he had learned ''that mine fields are best avoided and gone around rather than walked through.''The poor man. He probably thought that he came all this way to talk about how to fight the war, not to talk about how to talk about the war.Op-Ed ColumnistDick Durbin went to the floor of the Senate on Thursday night to denounce the vice president as ''delusional.''It was shocking, and Senator Durbin should be ashamed of himself.Delusional is far too mild a word to describe Dick Cheney. Delusional doesn't begin to capture the profound, transcendental one-flew-over daftness of the man.Has anyone in the history of the United States ever been so singularly wrong and misguided about such phenomenally important events and continued to insist he's right in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary?It requires an exquisite kind of lunacy to spend hundreds of billions destroying America's reputation in the world, exhausting the U.S. military, failing to catch Osama, enhancing Iran's power in the Middle East and sending American kids to train and arm Iraqi forces so they can work against American interests.Only someone with an inspired alienation from reality could, under the guise of exorcising the trauma of Vietnam, replicate the trauma of Vietnam.You must have a real talent for derangement to stay wrong every step of the way, to remain in complete denial about Iraq's civil war, to have a total misunderstanding of Arab culture, to be completely oblivious to the American mood and to be absolutely blind to how democracy works.In a democracy, when you run a campaign that panders to homophobia by attacking gay marriage and then your lesbian daughter writes a book about politics and decides to have a baby with her partner, you cannot tell Wolf Blitzer he's ''out of line'' when he gingerly raises the hypocrisy of your position.Mr. Cheney acts more like a member of the James gang than the Jefferson gang. Asked by Wolf what would happen if the Senate passed a resolution critical of The Surge, Scary Cheney rumbled, ''It won't stop us.''Such an exercise in democracy, he noted, would be ''detrimental from the standpoint of the troops.''Americans learned an important lesson from Vietnam about supporting the troops even when they did not support the war. From media organizations to Hollywood celebrities and lawmakers on both sides, everyone backs our troops.It is W. and Vice who learned no lessons from Vietnam, probably because they worked so hard to avoid going. They rush into a war halfway around the world for no reason and with no foresight about the culture or the inevitable insurgency, and then assert that any criticism of their fumbling management of Iraq and Afghanistan is tantamount to criticizing the troops. Quel demagoguery.''Bottom line,'' Vice told Wolf, ''is that we've had enormous successes, and we will continue to have enormous successes.'' The biggest threat, he said, is that Americans may not ''have the stomach for the fight.''He should stop casting aspersions on the American stomach. We've had the stomach for more than 3,000 American deaths in a war sold as a cakewalk.If W. were not so obsessed with being seen as tough, Mr. Cheney could not influence him with such tripe.They are perpetually guided by the wrong part of the body. They are consumed by the fear of looking as if they don't have guts, when they should be compelled by the desire to look as if they have brains.After offering Congress an olive branch in the State of the Union, the president resumed mindless swaggering. Asked yesterday why he was ratcheting up despite the resolutions, W. replied, ''In that I'm the decision maker, I had to come up with a way forward that precluded disaster.'' (Or preordained it.)The reality of Iraq, as The Times's brilliant John Burns described it to Charlie Rose this week, is that a messy endgame could be far worse than Vietnam, leading to ''a civil war on a scale with bloodshed that will absolutely dwarf what we're seeing now,'' and a ''wider conflagration, with all kinds of implications for the world's flow of oil, for the state of Israel. What happens to King Abdullah in Jordan if there's complete chaos in the region?''Mr. Cheney has turned his perversity into foreign policy.He assumes that the more people think he's crazy, the saner he must be. In Dr. No's nutty world-view, anti-Americanism is a compliment. The proof that America is right is that everyone thinks it isn't.He sees himself as a prophet in the wilderness because he thinks anyone in the wilderness must be a prophet.To borrow one of his many dismissive words, it's hogwash.Op-Ed ColumnistWhen she was little, Hillary Rodham would sit on a basement bench and pretend she was flying a spaceship to Mars. Her younger brother Hugh, perched behind, would sometimes beg for a chance to be captain.No dice. ''She would always drive, and I would always have to sit in the back,'' he once told me.Through all the years of sitting behind Bill Clinton on his trip to the stars, Hillary fidgeted and elbowed, trying to be co-captain rather than just wingman, or worse, winglady.Finally, in Iowa, she was once more behind the wheel of her spaceship to Mars. She didn't have to prop up Bill after one of his roguish pratfalls. She didn't have to feign interest in East Wing piffle -- table settings and pastry chefs and designer gowns. She didn't have to defer to her male colleagues in the Senate, stepping back to give them the limelight.She positively glistened as she talked about how ''I'' -- rather than the ''we'' of '92 -- would run the world.Humbly, graciously, deftly, she offered Iowa the answer to that eternal question, What Is Hillary Owed?Everything.John Wood, a self-described ''plainsman,'' Republican and machinery-and-tool salesman from Davenport, asked Hillary how she would handle the world's evil and bad men, provoking the slyly ambiguous retort: ''What in my background equips me to deal with evil and bad men?''He said afterward that he was more worried about her ability to face down villains, ''being a lady,'' but conceded, ''The woman did good today.''(His question was reminiscent of Ali G's interview of Newt Gingrich, when the faux rapper asked whether a woman president would be turned on and manipulated by evil dictators, given that, with women, ''the worse you treat 'em, the more they want you.'')As YouTube attests, Hillary didn't care about style as first lady; she was too busy trying to get in on Bill's substance. She showed off a long parade of unflattering outfits and unnervingly changing hairdos.In Iowa, her national anthem may have been off-key, but her look wasn't. It was an attractive mirror of her political message: man-tailored with a dash of pink femininity.''I think you look very nice,'' a veteran of the first gulf war told her in Des Moines.''Thank you!'' she answered, beaming and laughing.When Geraldine Ferraro made her historic run in '84, she tried to blend a mother's concerns into her foreign policy answers, but it did not work so well once she started getting her nuclear terminology mixed up.Hillary dealt with the issue head-on -- ''I'm a woman; I'm a mom'' -- hoping to stir that sisterly vote that Ms. Ferraro failed to draw after it turned out that many women were skeptical about one of their own facing down the Soviets.Unlike Barack Obama, who once said he was bored by the suburbs, she introduced herself in the land of bingo and bacon as a product of the suburbs, wallowing in the minutiae of kitchen-table issues.W. and Cheney have lavished attention and money on Iraq, leaving Americans feeling neglected. Hillary offered Iowans a warm bath of ''you,'' homey rumination rather than harsh domination.(Though Jon Stewart warned on ''The Daily Show'' that her slogan -- ''Let the conversation begin!'' -- will not help her with men. ''I think the typical response would be, 'Now?' '' he said, adding that her new Iraq policy is, ''America, let's pull over and just ask for directions.'')Thomasine Johnson, a 66-year-old African-American from outside Des Moines, complained that Hillary talked too much about ''traditional women's issues,'' but many in the audiences seemed enthralled.The Achilles' heel of ''The Warrior,'' as she is known, is the war. She expressed outrage about Iraq, but ended up sounding like a mother whose teenage son has not cleaned up his room: ''The president has said this is going to be left to his successor  and I think it's the height of irresponsibility, and I really resent it.''She uttered the most irritating and disingenuous nine words in politics: ''If we had known then what we know now. ''Jim Webb knew. Barack Obama knew. Even I knew, for Pete's sake. The administration's trickery was clear in real time.Hillary didn't have the nerve to oppose a popular president on a national security issue after 9/11, and she feared being cast as an antiwar hippie when she ran. Now she feels she can't simply say she made a bad decision. And that makes her seem conniving -- not a good mix with nurturing.Op-Ed Columnist''Everything you've heard and read is true. And I am deeply sorry about that.'' Who said it?(a) George Bush, about the chilling new intelligence report on Iraq.(b) Joe Biden, about his self-imploding prolixity.(c) Condi Rice, on her ability to understand Peyton Manning's vulnerabilities better than Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's.(d) Silvio Berlusconi, on his wife's Junoesque lightning bolt after his public flirting.(e) Jacques Chirac, after giving a Gallic shrug at the prospect of Iran's getting un or deux nuclear weapons.(f) Hillary Clinton, on enabling the president to invade Iraq.(g) Barack Obama, for the ultimate sin of not being black enough or white enough.(h) Mary Cheney, on her decision to stick with her terrifying dad's homophobic campaign because the thought of John Kerry was ''terrifying.''(i) Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, about his affair with his campaign manager's wife.The answer is Gavin Newsom.It's rare to get a simple apology when a complex obfuscation will do.Even after releasing parts of an intelligence report so pessimistic that it may as well have been titled ''Iraq: We're Cooked,'' Bush officials clung to their alternate reality, using nonsensical logic and cherry-picking whatever phrases they could find in the report that they could use to sell the Surge.In the 2004 National Intelligence Estimate, civil war was a worst-case scenario. In the 2007 one, Iraq has zoomed past civil war to hell: ''The Intelligence Community judges that the term 'civil war' does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict in Iraq, which includes extensive Shia-on-Shia violence, Al Qaeda and Sunni insurgent attacks on coalition forces, and widespread criminally motivated violence.''As John McLaughlin, the former acting director of central intelligence, told The Times's Mark Mazzetti: ''Civil war is checkers. This is chess.''Far from Dick Cheney's claim of ''enormous successes'' and Gen. George Casey's claim of ''slow progress,'' the report shows that any path the U.S. takes in Iraq could lead to a river of blood. It says that in the absence of any strong Sunni and Shiite leaders who can control their groups, prospects are dim for a cohesive government, much less a democracy.If the violence gets worse, the report concludes, three sulfurous possibilities loom: chaos leading to partition, the emergence of a Shiite strongman, or anarchy ''mixing extreme ethnosectarian violence with debilitating intragroup clashes.''So after four years of war, we get to choose between chaos, another Saddam or anarchy. Good work, W. And at such bargain prices; the administration is breaking the record for the military budget, asking for $100 billion or so for Iraq and Afghanistan this year and more than $140 billion for 2008.The White House thinks it can somehow spin the Iraq apocalypse so it sounds as if multiple wars are better than one civil war.At a Pentagon briefing yesterday, Bob Gates rebuffed the idea of a civil war, saying: ''I think that the words 'civil war' oversimplify a very complex situation in Iraq. I believe that there are essentially four wars going on in Iraq. One is Shia on Shia, principally in the south. The second is sectarian conflict, principally in Baghdad, but not solely. Third is the insurgency, and fourth is Al Qaeda.''That's a relief, all right -- we're in four wars in Iraq and threatening another with Iran.Stephen Hadley, the national security adviser, agreed that the term civil war is unacceptable: ''We need to get across the complexities of the situation we face in Iraq  and simple labels don't do that.''When General Casey testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, he sounded as if he was talking about a completely different Iraq than the one limned in the intelligence report. ''Today,'' he said, ''Iraqis are poised to assume responsibility for their own security by the end of 2007, still with some level of support from us.''Compare that with the bleak tone of the report, which states that ''the Iraqi Security Forces (ISS) -- particularly the Iraqi police -- will be hard-pressed in the next 12 to 18 months to execute significantly increased security responsibilities, and particularly to operate independently against Shia militias with success.''It's official. We're in a cycle of violence so complex and awful that withdrawing American troops will make it worse and keeping American troops there may also make it worse.We can try or we can leave, but either way, it seems, we're cooked.Op-Ed ColumnistIt's not double jeopardy exactly, but still, I'd prefer not to kill the same man twice.And I wanted to follow William Safire's advice on writing about gaffes and graft: Only kick people when they're up, not when they're down.So I decided to do something completely radical and not pile on.Having played a role in derailing Joe Biden's '88 presidential bid with stories on his overreliance on the speeches of Neil Kinnock and Bobby Kennedy, I feel compelled, now that the guy has slipped on another presidential banana peel 20 years later, to lend him a hand.I wanted to give him a chance to wipe the slate clean and articulate his positions -- without dredging up any painful memories of the words ''clean'' and ''articulate.''The senator called me between New York fund-raisers last night. After his rough week, he sounded a bit chastened, not at all in the mood for a columnist's probing questions. He needn't have feared.''So,'' I asked him sweetly, ''why has everyone been so mean to you?''''Well,'' he demurred, ''they haven't been mean. The truth is, a lot of people in the African-American community were hurt by what I said. I really feel lousy about it. I got involved in politics because of civil rights.'' (He said a lot more, but hey, it's a 750-word column.) I had another penetrating question ready: ''Is Delaware big enough to launch a president?'' ''I think it is,'' he replied.I had a tough follow-up: ''Will your first act as president be to get rid of those tollbooths on I-95?'' He laughed. ''I get asked that a lot by people. I can't help 'em -- they're on their own.''That's the straight talk I like to see. No pandering, like Hillary's telling Iowans she likes ethanol, and John McCain's telling Christian conservatives he likes Christian conservatives.''People don't seem to appreciate your verbal generosity,'' I said. ''Are you studying Bogie and Steve McQueen movies to become less wordy, or do you just hope people will come to see it as part of your charm?''''We're in a political culture where everything is reduced to bumper stickers and sound bites, and it's a lot more complicated than that,'' he said. ''I'm fairly candid, and sometimes I'll cause controversy and sometimes I won't. It's who I am. I'm not going to change who I am.''That's my man. He stares controversy in the eye and chats with it.''In one sentence, with no more than two dependent clauses,'' I instruct, ''tell me why you would make a great president.''''I really believe the American people get the fact that with the next president, there's no margin for error. He's going to inherit a world and a nation where this guy is going to leave him in a real deep hole. The next president has to get us out of Iraq without ruining the Middle East, so Americans should be looking for the person with the most experience.''O.K., that's three sentences, but who's counting?''You've been a truth-teller on Iraq for years, so tell the truth,'' I said. ''Are we cooked?'' Citing the soft-partition plan he co-wrote, he noted: ''Any country that comes into being as a consequence of the pen of a diplomat has never been able to be stable except by (a) an imperial power dominating it, (b) a dictator or strongman, or (c) a federal system.''Aren't Americans going to be angry at a Senate that's bending itself into a procedural pretzel, rather than seriously tackling the future of Iraq?''They are going to be angry,'' he agreed. ''Republicans are trying to avoid embarrassing the president. If you took a secret ballot, I'd be dumfounded if 20 senators thought sending 21,500 troops made any sense.'' He said John McCain wouldn't think it made sense either ''because he has called for sending many more.''Do you agree that Dick Cheney is barking mad?''Cheney is a very smart guy who's kicking the can down the road here,'' he replied. ''He's concluded that this administration's policy can't succeed in Iraq and he's handing it off to the next guy.''Things were getting way too serious. ''What's your ideal day?''''It would be corny,'' he said. ''Just taking off to the beach with Jill.''Trying to boost his dented confidence, I said I was sure he looked better in the Delaware waves than Barack Obama in the Hawaiian surf. The 64-year-old laughed, saying, ''Like the Paul McCartney song, 'When I'm 64.' I don't look as good as I once did, but Jill does.''''Who would make the best president?'' I coaxed.''Me,'' he crowed.I think his confidence is coming back. Excellent.Op-Ed ColumnistI was cruising through Borders, looking for a copy of ''Nostromo.''Suddenly I was swimming in pink. I turned frantically from display table to display table, but I couldn't find a novel without a pink cover. I was accosted by a sisterhood of cartoon women, sexy string beans in minis and stilettos, fashionably dashing about book covers with the requisite urban props -- lattes, books, purses, shopping bags, guns and, most critically, a diamond ring.Was it a Valentine's Day special?No, I realized with growing alarm, chick lit was no longer a niche. It had staged a coup of the literature shelves. Hot babes had shimmied into the grizzled old boys' club, the land of Conrad, Faulkner and Maugham. The store was possessed with the devil spawn of ''The Devil Wears Prada.'' The blood-red high heel ending in a devil's pitchfork on the cover of the Lauren Weisberger best seller might as well be driving a stake through the heart of the classics.I even found Sylvia Plath's ''The Bell Jar'' with chick-lit pretty-in-pink lettering.''Penis lit versus Venus lit,'' said my friend Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, who was with me. ''An unacceptable choice.''''Looking for Mr. Goodbunny'' by Kathleen O'Reilly sits atop George Orwell's ''1984.'' ''Mine Are Spectacular!'' by Janice Kaplan and Lynn Schnurnberger hovers over ''Ulysses.'' Sophie Kinsella's ''Shopaholic'' series cuddles up to Rudyard Kipling.Even Will Shakespeare is buffeted by rampaging 30-year-old heroines, each one frantically trying to get their guy or figure out if he's the right guy, or if he meant what he said, or if he should be with them instead of their BFF or cousin, or if he'll come back, or if she'll end up stuck home alone eating Häagen-Dazs and watching ''CSI'' and ''Sex and the City'' reruns.Trying to keep up with soap-opera modernity, ''Romeo and Juliet'' has been reissued with a perky pink cover.There are subsections of chick lit: black chick lit (''Diva Diaries''), Bollywood chick lit (''Salaam, Paris''), Jewish chick lit (''The J.A.P. Chronicles'' and ''The Matzo Ball Heiress'') and assistant lit, which has its own subsection of Hollywood-assistant lit (''The Second Assistant''), mystery lit (''Sex, Murder and a Double Latte''), shopping lit (''Retail Therapy''), the self-loathing genre (''This Is Not Chick Lit'') and Brit chick lit (''Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging'').The narrator of that last, Georgia, begins with a note to her readers: ''Hello, American-type chums! (Perhaps you say 'Howdy' in America -- I don't know -- but then I'm not really sure where Tibet is either, or my lipstick.)  I hope you like my diary and don't hold it against me that my great-great-great-grandparents colonized you. (Not just the two of them. ).''Giving the books an even more interchangeable feeling is the bachelorette party of log-rolling blurbs by chick-lit authors. Jennifer ''Good in Bed'' Weiner blurbs Sarah Mlynowski's ''Me vs. Me'' and Karen McCullah Lutz's ''The Bachelorette Party.'' Lauren Weisberger blurbs Emily ''Something Borrowed'' Giffin.I took home three dozen of the working women romances. They can lull you into a hypnotic state with their simple life lessons -- one heroine emulated Doris Day, another Audrey Hepburn, one was the spitting image of Carolyn Bessette, another Charlize Theron -- but they're a long way from Becky Sharp and Elizabeth Bennet. They're all chick and no lit.Please do not confuse these books with the love-and-marriage of Jane Austen. These are more like multicultural Harlequin romances. They're Cinderella bodice rippers -- Manolo trippers -- girls with long legs, long shiny hair and sparkling eyes stumbling through life, eating potato skins loaded with bacon bits and melted swiss, drinking cocktails, looking for the right man and dispensing nuggets of hard-won wisdom, like, ''Any guy who can watch you hurl Cheez Doodles is a keeper,'' and, ''You can't puke in wicker. It leaks.''In the 19th century in America, people often linked the reading of novels with women. Women were creatures of sensibility, and men were creatures of action. But now, Leon suggested, American fiction seems to be undergoing a certain re-feminization.''These books do not seem particularly demanding in the manner of real novels,'' Leon said. ''And when we're at war and the country is under threat, they seem a little insular. America's reading women could do a lot worse than to put down 'Will Francine Get Her Guy?' and pick up 'The Red Badge of Courage.' ''The novel was once said to be a mirror of its times. In my local bookstore, it's more like a makeup mirror.Op-Ed ColumnistBarack Obama looked as if he needed a smoke and he needed it bad.Everyone knows you're not supposed to make two big changes at once. But Michelle Obama's price for letting her husband run was that he quit.So there he was, trying to meet the deep, inexhaustible needs of both Iowa activists and the global press behemoth on his first swing across the state, while giving up cigarettes.He was a tad testy. Traipsing around desolate stretches of snowy -- and extremely white -- Iowa to go into living rooms and high school gyms and take questions like ''Are you willing to stand up for independent family farmers?'' makes me want to sneak out for a drag, too, and I don't even smoke.''I've been chewing Nicorette all day long,'' he told reporters at a press conference in Ames on Sunday, where he was getting irritated at suggestions that he lacked substance and at the specter of his vanishing privacy. And, oh yes, at the accusation by the Australian prime minister (sounding two sheep short of a paddock) that Mr. Obama's deadline to get out of Iraq made him Al Qaeda's dream candidate.The Illinois senator didn't have on an implacable mask of amiability, as Hillary did in Iowa. He didn't look happily in his element, like Bill Clinton. But he certainly didn't look as if he was straining to survive the Q .& A.'s, as W. did in the beginning.Beyond his smooth-jazz façade, the reassuring baritone and that ensorcelling smile, the 45-year-old had moments of looking conflicted.In the lobby of the AmericInn in Iowa Falls on Saturday night, he seemed a bit dazed by his baptism into the big-time. He was left munching trail mix all day while, he said, ''the press got fed before me.''Everything was a revelation for him: The advance team acronym RON, for Rest Overnight. Women squealing. ''I saw a hat,'' he noted with a grin, ''that said, 'Obama, clean and articulate.' ''Senator Obama's body language was loose -- and he's so slender his wedding band looked as if it was slipping off -- but there was a wariness in his dark eyes.He is backed up by a strong, smart wife and a professional campaign team, but he doesn't have a do-whatever-it-takes family firm with contract killers and debt collectors, like Bush Inc. and Clinton Inc.He was eloquent, if not as inspiring as his advance billing had prepared audiences to expect. He made his first Swift-boat-able slip when he had to apologize for talking about soldiers' lives ''wasted'' in Iraq. He sounded self-consciously pristine at times, as if he was too refined for the muck of politics. That's not how you beat anybody but Alan Keyes.After talking to high school journalists, he took a sniffy shot at the loutish reporters who were merely whispering where's the beef: ''Take some notes, guys, that's how it's done.''No fewer than three times last week, Mr. Obama got indignant about the beach-babe attention given to a shot of him in the Hawaiian surf.Using the dreaded third person that some candidates slip into, he told reporters that one of their favorite narratives boiled down to ''Obama has pretty good style, he can deliver a pretty good speech, but he seems to prioritize rhetoric over substance.'' After an ode to his own specificity, he tut-tutted, ''You've been reporting on how I look in a swimsuit.''He poses for the cover of Men's Vogue and then gets huffy when people don't treat him as Hannah Arendt.For some of us, it's hard to fathom being upset at getting accused of looking great in a bathing suit. But his friends say it played into this Harvard grad's fear of being seen as ''a dumb blond.'' He has been known to privately mock ''pretty boys'' (read John Edwards, the Breck Girl of 2004).He doesn't lack confidence, but he's so hung up on being seen as thoughtful that he sometimes comes across as too emotionally detached and cerebral with crowds yearning for an electric, visceral connection. J.F.K. mixed cool with fire.For a man who couldn't wait to inject himself into the national arena, and who has spent so much time writing books about himself, the senator is oddly put off by press inquisitiveness.When The Times's Jeff Zeleny asked him on his plane whether he'd had a heater in his podium during his announcement speech in subzero Springfield, Mr. Obama hesitated. He shot Jeff a look that said, ''Are you from People magazine?'' before conceding that, unlike Abe Lincoln, he'd had a heater.Take some notes, senator, that's how it's done.Op-Ed ColumnistSo I was sitting around watching ''Oprah'' yesterday afternoon when I realized how I could stop W. and Crazy Dick from blowing up any more stuff.All I needed to do was Unleash my Unfathomable Magnetic Power into the Universe!Energy flows where intention goes. Or maybe it's the other way around.Anyhow, Oprah taught me how to stop abusing myself and learn The Secret. I finally get it: because the Law of Attraction dictates that like attracts like, my negativity toward the president and vice president is attracting their negativity and multiplying the negative vibrations in the cosmos, creating some sort of giant doom magnet.I need to examine my unforgiving stance toward them and use my power of visualization to let them know that in my consciousness and awareness, they cannot determine my destiny. I am severing those emotional and vibratory tonalities that keep me tied to their toxic energy, causing me to repeat the same old pattern of bemoaning in the newspaper their same old pattern of blundering in the Middle East.Oprah did her second show in eight days on ''The Secret,'' the self-help book (and DVD) by Rhonda Byrne, an Australian reality-TV producer. The book hit No. 1 on the USA Today best-seller list this week.At first glance, ''The Secret'' might seem like inane piffle, a psychobabble cross between Dr. Phil and ''The Da Vinci Code,'' a new-age spin on Norman Vincent Peale's 1952 classic, ''The Power of Positive Thinking'' and the Beach Boys' ''Good Vibrations.'' But that's a negative way of thinking.James Arthur Ray, a teacher of The Secret method, who talked to Oprah, says it's ''very, very scientific.''''If you think you're this meat suit running around, you know, you have to think again,'' he said. ''You're a field of energy in a larger field of energy.''Oprah enthused that The Secret ''really is touching a nerve around the world'' because ''so many people are hungry for guidance and meaning.'' Ms. Byrne claims it improved her eyesight; others say it works on everything from weight loss to panic attacks to getting rich to snagging the mate of your dreams or a good parking space.''We create our own circumstances by the choices that we make, and the choices that we make are fueled by our thoughts,'' Oprah explained in her first show. ''So our thoughts are the most powerful thing that we have here on earth. And based upon what we think -- and [what] we think determines who we are -- we attract who we are into our lives.''Or as the book so eloquently puts it, ''You must feel good about You.''If it works on eyesight, can't it work on foresight? Can't we use The Secret on the secretive Bush White House to prevent a calamity in Iran?According to the Sacred Principles set out by the Law of Attraction Specialists, the universe responds to your thoughts. So if I want certified chuckleheads to stop mucking up American foreign policy, all I have to do is let the universe know. I forgive the president for being a goose and the vice president for being a snake, and I start thinking about the sort of amazing, or even mildly competent, leaders I deserve to have in my life.Maybe W. should read the book. He likes things biblical, and ''The Secret'' says it takes its Creative Process from the New Testament.He would learn, as Mr. Ray said, that ''trying is failing with honor,'' adding: ''Take the word 'try' out of your vocabulary. You either do it or you don't.''W. could have applied that to Iraq, where he has always done only enough to fail, including with the Surge.A main tenet of The Secret is learning to avoid the chain reaction of churlishness, which begins with a single thought: ''The one bad thought attracted more bad thoughts, the frequency locked in, and eventually something went wrong. Then as you reacted to that one thing going wrong, you attracted more things going wrong.''It's an apt description of Iraq policy. A bad thought that led to more bad thoughts, and the negative frequency is now locked in on Iran, which is responding with its own negative frequency.With The Secret, W. will realize that all he needs to do to change his current reality is admit that it's fake. (Similar to the wisdom of Dorothy clicking her shoes three times.)Once he stops his chain reaction of negative thought, I can stop my chain reaction of negative thought. And then there will be peace on earth and parking spaces for everyone.Op-Ed ColumnistHillary is not David Geffen's dreamgirl.''Whoever is the nominee is going to win, so the stakes are very high,'' says Mr. Geffen, the Hollywood mogul and sultan of ''Dreamgirls,'' as he sits by a crackling fire beneath a Jasper Johns flag and a matched pair of de Koonings in the house that Jack Warner built (which old-time Hollywood stars joked was the house that God would have built). ''Not since the Vietnam War has there been this level of disappointment in the behavior of America throughout the world, and I don't think that another incredibly polarizing figure, no matter how smart she is and no matter how ambitious she is -- and God knows, is there anybody more ambitious than Hillary Clinton? -- can bring the country together.''Obama is inspirational, and he's not from the Bush royal family or the Clinton royal family. Americans are dying every day in Iraq. And I'm tired of hearing James Carville on television.''Barack Obama has made an entrance in Hollywood unmatched since Scarlett O'Hara swept into the Twelve Oaks barbecue. Instead of the Tarleton twins, the Illinois senator is flirting with the DreamWorks trio: Mr. Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who gave him a party last night that raised $1.3 million and Hillary's hackles.She didn't stand outside the gates to the Geffen mansion, where glitterati wolfed down Wolfgang Puck savories, singing the Jennifer Hudson protest anthem ''And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going.'' But she's not exactly Little Miss Sunshine, either. Hillary loyalists have hissed at defecting donors to remember the good old days of jumping on the Lincoln Bedroom bed.''Hillary is livid that Obama's getting the first big fund-raiser here,'' one friend of hers said.Who can pay attention to the Oscar battle between ''The Queen'' and ''Dreamgirls'' when you've got a political battle between a Queen and a Dreamboy?Terry McAuliffe and First Groupie Bill have tried to hoard the best A.T.M. machine in politics for the Missus, but there's some Clinton fatigue among fatigued Clinton donors, who fret that Bill will ''pull the focus'' and shelve his wife's campaign.''I don't think anybody believes that in the last six years, all of a sudden Bill Clinton has become a different person,'' Mr. Geffen says, adding that if Republicans are digging up dirt, they'll wait until Hillary's the nominee to use it. ''I think they believe she's the easiest to defeat.''She is overproduced and overscripted. ''It's not a very big thing to say, 'I made a mistake' on the war, and typical of Hillary Clinton that she can't,'' Mr. Geffen says. ''She's so advised by so many smart advisers who are covering every base. I think that America was better served when the candidates were chosen in smoke-filled rooms.''The babble here is not about ''Babel''; it's about the battle of the billionaires. Not only have Ron Burkle and David Geffen been vying to buy The Los Angeles Times -- they have been vying to raise money for competing candidates. Mr. Burkle, a supermarket magnate, is close to the Clintons, and is helping Hillary parry Barry Obama by arranging a fund-raiser for her in March, with a contribution from Mr. Spielberg.Did Mr. Spielberg get in trouble with the Clintons for helping Senator Obama? ''Yes,'' Mr. Geffen replies, slyly. Can Obambi stand up to Clinton Inc.? ''I hope so,'' he says, ''because that machine is going to be very unpleasant and unattractive and effective.''Once, David Geffen and Bill Clinton were tight as ticks. Mr. Geffen helped raise some $18 million for Bill and slept in the Lincoln Bedroom twice. Bill chilled at Chateau Geffen. Now, the DreamWorks co-chairman calls the former president ''a reckless guy'' who ''gave his enemies a lot of ammunition to hurt him and to distract the country.''They fell out in 2001, when Mr. Clinton gave a pardon to Marc Rich after rebuffing Mr. Geffen's request for one for Leonard Peltier. ''Marc Rich getting pardoned? An oil-profiteer expatriate who left the country rather than pay taxes or face justice?'' Mr. Geffen says. ''Yet another time when the Clintons were unwilling to stand for the things that they genuinely believe in. Everybody in politics lies, but they do it with such ease, it's troubling.''The mogul knows it's easy to mock Hollywood -- ''people with Priuses and private planes'' -- and agrees with George Clooney that it's probably not helpful for stars to campaign for candidates, given the caricatures of Hollywood.I ask what he will say if he ever runs into Bill Clinton again. '' 'Hi,' '' he replies. And will he be upset if Hillary wins and he never gets to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom again?''No,'' he says with a puckish smile. ''It's not as nice as my bedroom.''Thomas L. Friedman is off today.Op-Ed ColumnistSo some guy stands up after John McCain's luncheon speech here yesterday to a group of business types and asks him a question.''I've seen in the press where in your run for the presidency, you've been sucking up to the religious right,'' the man said, adding, ''I was just wondering how soon do you predict a Republican candidate for president will start sucking up to the old Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party?''Mr. McCain listened with his eyes downcast, then looked the man in the eye, smiled and replied: ''I'm probably going to get in trouble, but what's wrong with sucking up to everybody?'' It was a flash of the old McCain, and the audience laughed.Certainly, the senator has tried to worm his way into the affections of W. and the religious right: the Discovery Institute, a group that tries to derail Darwinism and promote the teaching of intelligent design, helped present the lunch, dismaying liberal bloggers who have tracked Mr. McCain's devolution on evolution.A reporter asked the senator if his pandering on Roe v. Wade had made him ''the darling and candidate of the ultra right wing?'' (In South Carolina earlier this week, he tried to get more evangelical street cred by advocating upending Roe v. Wade.) ''I dispute that assertion,'' he replied. ''I believe that it was Dr. Dobson recently who said that he prayed that I would not receive the Republican nomination. I was just over at Starbucks this morning.  I talk everywhere, and I try to reach out to everyone.''But there's one huge group that he's not pandering to: Americans.Most Americans are sick and tired of watching things go hideously backward in Iraq and Afghanistan, and want someone to show them the way out. Mr. McCain is stuck on the bridge of a sinking policy with W. and Dick Cheney, who showed again this week that there is no bottom to his lunacy. The senator supported a war that didn't need to be fought and is a cheerleader for a surge that won't work.It has left the Arizona Republican, once the most joyous and spontaneous of campaigners, off balance. He's like a cat without its whiskers. When the moderator broached the subject of Iraq after lunch, Mr. McCain grimaced, stuck out his tongue a little and said sarcastically, ''Thanks.''Defending his stance, he sounds like a Bill Gates robot prototype, repeating in a monotone: ''I believe we've got a new strategy.  It can succeed. I can't guarantee success. But I do believe firmly that if we get out now we risk chaos and genocide in the region.''He was asked about Britain's decision to withdraw 1,600 troops from Iraq. ''Tony Blair, the prime minister, has shown great political courage,'' Mr. McCain said. ''He has literally sacrificed his political career because of Iraq, my friends,'' because he thought ''it was the right thing to do.''He said he worried that Iranian-backed Shiites were taking more and more control of southern Iraq. (That was probably because the Brits kept peace in southern Iraq all along by giving Iranian-backed Shiites more and more control.) And he noted that the British are sending more troops to Afghanistan, ''which is very necessary because we're going to have a very hot spring in Afghanistan.''But then he got back to Tony Blair sacrificing his political career, and it was clear that he was also talking about himself. When a reporter later asked him if Iraq might consume his candidacy, he replied evenly: ''Sure.''I asked him whether he got discouraged when he read stories like the one in The Wall Street Journal yesterday about Ahmad Chalabi, the man who helped goad and trick the U.S. into war, who wound up with ''a position inside the Iraqi government that could help determine whether the Bush administration's new push to secure Baghdad succeeds.''Or the New York Times article yesterday about a couple of Iraqi policemen who joined American forces on searches in Baghdad, but then turned quisling, running ahead to warn residents to hide their weapons and other incriminating evidence.He nodded. ''One of the big question marks is how the Maliki government will step up to the plate,'' he said.And how, I asked him, can Dick Cheney tell ABC News that British troops' getting out is ''an affirmation that there are parts of Iraq where things are going pretty well,'' while he says that Democrats who push to get America out would ''validate the Al Qaeda strategy''? Isn't that a nutty contradiction?But Senator McCain was back on his robo-loop: ''I can only express my gratitude for the enormous help that the British have given us.''Sometimes I miss John McCain, even when I'm with him.Op-Ed ColumnistAl Gore now has a movie with an Oscar and a grandson named Oscar.Who could ask for anything more?Al Gore could.The best ex-president who was never president could make one of the most interesting campaigns in American history even more interesting. Will he use his green moment on the red carpet in black tie to snag blue states and win the White House?Only the Goracle knows the answer.The man who was prescient on climate change, the Internet, terrorism and Iraq admitted that maybe his problem had been that he was too far ahead of the curve. He realized at a conference that ''there're ideas that are mature, ideas that are maturing, ideas that are past their prime  and a category called 'predawn.'''And all of a sudden it hit me,'' he told John Heilemann of New York magazine last year. ''Most of my political career was spent investing in predawn ideas! I thought, Oh, that's where I went wrong.''As Mr. Gore basked Sunday night in the adoration of Leo, Laurie David and the rest of the Hollywood hybrid-drivers, Democrats wondered: Is this chubby guy filling out the Ralph Lauren three-piece tuxedo a mature idea or an idea that's past its prime?With Hillary overproduced and Barack Obama an unfinished script, maybe it's time to bring the former vice president out of turnaround.Hillary's henchmen try to prognosticate the Goracle's future by looking at his waistline, according to Newsday; they think if he's going to run, he'll get back to fighting weight.With her own talent for checking the weathervane, Hillary co-opted Mr. Gore's eco-speak right after the Oscars, talking environment throughout upstate New York. Given his past competition with Hillary, Mr. Gore must have delighted in seeing his star rise in Hollywood as hers dimmed.If he waits long enough to get into the race, all the usual-suspect-consultants will be booked -- which would be a boon for Mr. Gore, since his Hessian strategists in 2000 made him soft-pedal the environment, the very issue that makes him seem most passionate and authentic. The same slides about feedback loops and the interconnectedness of weather patterns that made his image-makers yawn just won his movie an Academy Award.But what's going on in his head? Like Jeb Bush, Al Gore was the good son groomed by a famous pol to be president, only to have it snatched away by a black sheep who didn't even know the name of the general running Pakistan (the same one he just sent Vice to try to push into line.) It must be excruciating not only to lose a presidency you've won because the Supreme Court turned partisan and stopped the vote, but to then watch the madness of King George and Tricky Dick II as they misled their way into serial catastrophes.Even though Chickenhawk Cheney finally got close to combat in Afghanistan, his explosive brush with a suicide bomber has not served as a wake-up call about the danger of Osama bin Laden's staying on the lam, and Afghanistan's slipping back into the claws of the Taliban and Al Qaeda while we are shackled to Iraq.A reporter asked Tony Snow yesterday what the attack on the Bagram Air Base that targeted the vice president and killed at least 23 people said about the Taliban's strength. ''I'm not sure it says anything,'' he replied.Mr. Gore must be pleased that he's been vindicated on so many fronts, yet it still must rankle the Nobel Peace Prize nominee to hear the White House spouting such dangerous nonsense. He must sometimes imagine how much safer the world would be if he were president.The Bush-Cheney years have been all about dragging the country into the past, getting back the presidential powers yanked away after Watergate, settling scores from Poppy Bush's old war, and suppressing scientific and environmental advances. Instead of aiming for the stars, the greatest power on earth is bogged down in poorly navigated conflicts with ancient tribes and brutes in caves.Surely the Goracle, an aficionado of futurism, must stew about all the time and money and good will that has been wasted with a Vietnam replay and a scolding social policy designed to expunge the Age of Aquarius.When he's finished Web surfing, tweaking his PowerPoint and BlackBerrying, what goes through his head? Does he blame himself? Does he blame the voting machines? Ralph Nader? Robert Shrum? Naomi Wolf? How about Bush Inc. and Clinton Inc.?With the red carpet rolled up, the tux at the cleaner's, and the gold statuette on the director's mantle, not his, the Goracle is at his Nashville mansion, contemplating how to broker his next deal. Will he cast himself as the savior of the post-Bush era, or will the first Gore in the Oval Office be Karenna, mother of Oscar?Op-Ed ColumnistAs I sit across from Barack Obama in his Senate office, I feel like Ingrid Bergman in ''The Bells of St. Mary's,'' when she plays a nun who teaches a schoolboy who's being bullied how to box.I'm just not certain, having watched the fresh-faced senator shy away from fighting with the feral Hillary over her Hollywood turf, that he understands that a campaign is inherently a conflict.The Democrats lost the last two excruciatingly close elections because Al Gore and John Kerry did not fight fiercely and cleverly enough.After David Geffen made critical comments about Hillary, she seized the chance to play Godzilla stomping on Obambi.As a woman, she clearly feels she must be aggressive in showing she can ''deck'' opponents, as she put it -- whether it's Saddam with her war resolution vote or Senator Obama when he encroaches on areas that she and Bill had presumed were wrapped up, like Hollywood and now the black vote.If Hillary is in touch with her masculine side, Barry is in touch with his feminine side.He turned up his nose at his campaign's sharp response to Hillary and her pinstriped thug, Howard Wolfson. He told The Times's Jeff Zeleny that he had not been engaged in the vituperative exchange because he was traveling on a red-eye flight, getting a haircut and taking his daughters to school.I ask why he couldn't have managed the donnybrook while he traveled and did errands. Since he's sitting across from me using his BlackBerry, I wonder: ''Where was your BlackBerry? Did your aides not ask you how to respond or did you not want to ride herd on them -- even just to tell them to ignore Hillary?''''Look, I came up through politics in Chicago,'' he says. ''When I arrived in Chicago in 1985, I didn't know a single person. Seventeen years later, I was the United States senator and in a position to run for president. So I must know a little something about politics.''Channeling Ingrid, I press on and say: ''I know you want to run a high-minded campaign, but do you worry that you might be putting yourself on a pedestal too much? Because people also want to see you mix it up a little. That's how they judge how you'd be with Putin.''''When I get into a tussle,'' he replies, ''I want it to be over something real, not something manufactured. If someone wants to get in an argument with me, let's argue about how we're going to fix the health care system or where we need to go on Iraq.''If campaigns follow the arc of the hero myth.''What's the demon that I've slain?'' he finishes. ''You're getting kind of deep on me here. I think that, for me, the story was overcoming a father's absence and reconciling the different strands of my background and coming out whole.''Has he ever been struck by the similiarity of Bill Clinton's growing up without his father?''You don't want to go on with too much pop psychology,'' he replies. ''Somebody said that every man is either trying to live up to his father's expectations or trying to make up for his father's mistakes. And in some ways, when your father's not there, you're doing both. You try to live up to the expectations of somebody who's not present to tell you that you've done a good job, but you're also trying to make up for the mistakes that partially led to his absence.''Does Al Gore have first dibs on the presidency?''I love Al Gore,'' he replies. ''He's a smart guy.'' He said he liked Mr. Gore's seriousness on issues he cares deeply about. ''This sounds clichéd, but this week I had five mothers of folks headed to Iraq cry during rope lines where I was shaking hands and had me hug 'em. This stuff is just not a game.  Now that doesn't mean that there's not the basic blocking and tackling of politics. I've got to raise money. I've got to manage my press. We've got to respond rapidly to attacks. But what I don't want to do is get drawn into the sport of it.''When the Tiger Woods of politics goes to a civil rights commemoration in Selma, Ala., this weekend -- just as the story breaks that his white ancestors had slaves -- he will compete for attention with Hillary and the man billed as the first black president. How does he feel about the Clintons double-teaming him?Talking about the woman he described at the Beverly Hills fund-raiser as smarter, better-looking and meaner then he is, he grins: ''My wife's pretty tough.''Op-Ed ColumnistWhen the Scooter Libby trial ended, the media was found guilty. By the media. Which likes to obsess on itself. In the media.The press gave short shrift to poor Scooter, whose downfall came from doing Dick Cheney's bidding with ''canine loyalty,'' as Chris Matthews told Don Imus yesterday morning. Scooter's facing hard time, even though others in the administration also spread the word about Valerie Plame.But let's get back to the media decrying the media, and the incestuous Beltway relationship between journalists and sources. Listening to all the lamentations, I excitedly realized I had a potentially incestuous relationship with a source inside the Beltway.I went to Nativity grade school in D.C. with Juror No. 9, Denis Collins. I had an unrequited crush on his brother when I was in seventh grade. His dad was my dad's lawyer, and both were Irish immigrants. My brother Kevin coached his brother Kevin in touch football. Our moms were in the Sodality together. His mom once chastised me for chatting up a little boy in church. We started in journalism together, Denis at The Washington Post as a sportswriter and Metro reporter, and me at The Washington Star as a sportswriter and Metro reporter.This was a sure thing. I could get him to come over to my house and spill all the secrets of the jury that had convicted the highest-ranking White House official to be found guilty on a felony since Iran-contra days.Unfortunately, Denis spilled them on the way over. By the time he got to my house, he was already so overexposed he announced, ''I'm sick of hearing myself talk.''From the moment he stepped out of the courthouse and into the press mob in his green Eddie Bauer jacket, Denis became the unofficial jury spokesman, bouncing from Larry King to Anderson Cooper and ''Good Morning America.'' I thought there still might be enough jury dish for me until I heard him say ''Huffington Post blog.''''Blogs are the future, right?'' he said, explaining that he'd already posted his diary of adventures in federal court -- right down to our incestuous Catholic past, which came up in the voir dire, when he also mentioned living across the alley from Tim Russert and working at The Post for Bob Woodward, and his nonfiction book about spying and the C.I.A.''I was the perfect storm,'' he said. Instead of me milking him for information, he tried to milk me for information. He asked about the pitfalls of being in a media maelstrom.''Somebody called me up today and said: 'Turn on Rush Limbaugh. He's saying terrible things about you.' ''I empathized. One of my brothers always used to call Mom and tell her: ''Turn on Rush Limbaugh. He's saying terrible things about Maureen.''Also, Denis's wife, Pam, told him gleefully that someone on TV was making fun of his jacket. ''Somebody said, 'What's with the green coat? It looks like something he got in high school.' '' I asked him if he'd used any lessons from the nuns. ''Accountability,'' he said. ''Do the right thing or get whacked over your head with the bell by Sister Mary Karen.''Was Scooter's fall Shakespearean? ''He's too many steps away from the king,'' he said. ''One of the jurors said, 'He was too busy looking out for No. 1; he should have been looking out for No. 2 and then he wouldn't have gotten in trouble.' One of the witnesses told us that Libby spent more time with Cheney than he did with his own wife and kids.''What did the jurors think of Scooter's wife? ''Well, the alleged wife,'' Denis corrected me. This was a very skeptical jury, then?''We didn't know anything about her,'' he said, adding: ''I said, 'So, that's Scooter Libby's wife?' and another juror jokingly said, 'Do you have any evidence?' '' So the jurors began calling her ''the alleged wife.''Like a good Catholic boy, he noted that the people who put ''the longest nails in Libby's hands were not reporters -- they were people who worked for the government.''I asked him how he would feel if W. pardoned Scooter.''I would really not care,'' he replied. ''I feel like the damage has been done in terms of his reputation and the administration's reputation.''And what about the calls for Dick Cheney to resign or get the boot?''Here's the thing: Libby followed Cheney's instructions to go talk to reporters, but there's no evidence at all that Cheney told him to lie about it. So the question is, was Libby just kind of inept at getting this story out?''Denis had to leave. He said he felt as if he were ''coming out of a tunnel.'' I just felt happy to have a hot source -- even if I had to share him with the whole Beltway.Maureen Dowd's column usually appears on Wednesdays and Saturdays.Op-Ed ColumnistThe mind reels at the mind.The Times's science section devoted itself yesterday to the topic of Desire, the myriad ways in which the human mind causes the body to get turned on.It now seems that instead of desire leading to arousal, as researchers once believed, arousal may lead to desire.The brain, as D. H. Lawrence once wrote, is a most important sexual organ, and men and women have extremely varied responses to sexual stimuli.As Natalie Angier, The Times's biology expert, noted, research has shown that women differed from men ''in the importance they accorded a man's physical appearance, with many expressing a comparatively greater likelihood of being aroused by evidence of talent or intelligence -- say, while watching a man deliver a great speech.''This could explain why many Republican women are so frustrated. They have been deprived of the bristly excitement of hearing their men on the stump delivering great speeches for quite some time now.The Daddy Party, sick with desire for a daddy, is like a lost child. John McCain, handcuffed to the Surge, announced yesterday he has the support of Henry Kissinger. Why not just drink poison? As the Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi slyly said, ''Leave it to Mitt Romney to shoot himself in the foot with a gun he doesn't own.''Rudy Giuliani, already haunted by the specters of Bernard Kerik's corruption and Judy Nathan's conjugal confusion, yesterday made things worse. He did the same thing John McCain did in South Carolina in 2000, a sickening pander the Arizona senator told ''60 Minutes'' Sunday that he did ''for all the wrong reasons.'' As Marc Santora reports from Montgomery, Rudy said he would leave the decision about whether to fly the Confederate flag over the Alabama State Capitol to the people of Alabama.Even cable news showed little interest in President Bush's big speech on Iraq yesterday, as he continued to excoriate Democrats for hurting the troops by trying to get an exit strategy, a day after Moktada al-Sadr's spokesman denounced the Liberator as ''the father of evil, Bush'' while Sadr thugs burned and shredded American flags and shouted, ''Leave, leave occupier.''Four years ago, the conservative commentator Kate O'Beirne thrilled at the sight of President Bush strutting in his flight suit and mocked Bill Clinton's doughy thighs, noting, ''Women don't want a guy to feel their pain, they want a guy to clean the gutters.'' But on ''Meet the Press'' Sunday, she sorrowfully admitted that Republicans had lost their national security swagger because of Iraq, and now have ''a real brand name problem'' and ''a competency problem.''''It used to be people thought they might not much like big government, but they can run it,'' she said of her party's leaders. ''Now they seem to like it fine, but not be able to run it at all.'' A point underscored by this week's Time cover: ''Why Our Army Is at the Breaking Point.''As Adam Nagourney and John Broder report in today's Times, Republican leaders are despondent and jittery as they watch their major candidates strain in sycophantic ways to prove their ideological credentials even as they see W.'s administration and war turning into an ever-tighter noose. Watching the Democrats' fund-raising advantage with alarm and astonishment, they concede it will be tough to hold the White House.Mr. Nagourney and Mr. Broder quote Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma who now lectures at Princeton, saying that the party does not have any candidates who are compelling. ''I just don't know,'' he adds, ''how they can run hard enough or fast enough to escape the gravitational pull of the Bush administration.''Except for Larry Birkhead, all the ''Who's your daddy?'' brio this week belongs to Senator Barack Obama, who told David Letterman he would not be Hillary's second on a ticket, and who remarkably managed to beat her on primary fund-raising with a more democratic and recyclable pool of donors.That feat of strength led to the hilarious spectacle of Terry McAuliffe, who had been using the Bush-Cheney line of you're-with-us-or-agin'-us to try to bully Democratic fat cats into giving solely to Hillary, telling ABC's Jake Tapper: ''Ultimately, forget the money. You've got to get the votes. And right now, Hillary wins in that category.''Like the panic in the Daddy Party, the crazed sputtering in the once-dominant Mommy Camp is something to behold.Hillary has been wielding Bill as a bludgeon on support and money. If you were ever behind him, you'd better fall into line behind her. But doesn't that undermine her presentation of herself as a self-reliant feminist aiming to be the first Madame President? If you can only win by leaning so heavily on your man for your muscle, isn't that a benign form of paternalism?Usually, spring in Washington finds us caught up in the cherry blossoms and the ursine courtship rituals of the pandas.But this chilly April, we are forced to contemplate the batrachian grapplings of Paul Wolfowitz, the man who cherry-picked intelligence to sell us a war with Iraq.You will not be surprised to learn, gentle readers, that Wolfie in love is no less deceptive and bumbling than Wolfie at war.Proving he is more con than neo, he confessed that he had not been candid with his staff at the World Bank. While he was acting holier than thou, demanding incorruptibility from poor countries desperate for loans, he was enriching his girlfriend with tax-free ducats.He has yet to admit any real mistakes with the hellish war that claimed five more American soldiers as stunned Baghdad residents dealt with the aftermath of bombings of the Iraqi Parliament, where body parts flew, and of a bridge over the Tigris, where cars sank.But he admitted on Thursday that he'd made a mistake when he got his sweetheart, Shaha Ali Riza, an Arab feminist who shares his passion for democratizing the Middle East, a raise to $193,590 -- more than the taxpaying (and taxing) Condi Rice makes. No doubt it seemed like small change compared with the money pit of remaking Iraq -- a task he once prophesied would be paid for with Iraqi oil money. Maybe he should have remunerated his girlfriend with Iraqi oil revenues, instead of ripping off the bank to advance his romantic agenda.No one is satisfied with his apology. Not the World Bank employees who booed Wolfie and yelled, ''Resign! Resign!'' in the bank lobby.Not Alison Cave, the chairwoman of the bank's staff association, who said that Mr. Wolfowitz must ''act honorably and resign.''Not his girlfriend, who says she's the suffering victim, forced by Wolfie's arrival to be sent to the State Department (where, in a festival of nepotism, she reported to Liz Cheney).And not his critics, who say Wolfie has been cherry-picking again, this time with his anticorruption crusade. They say he has used it to turn the bank into a tool for his unrealistic democracy campaign, which foundered in Baghdad, and for punishing countries that defy the United States.Wolfie also alienated the bank by bringing two highhanded aides with him from Bushworld, aides who had helped him with Iraq. One was the abrasive Robin Cleveland, called Wolfie's Rottweiler. The other was Kevin Kellems, known as Keeper of the Comb after his star turn in ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' where he handed his boss a comb so Wolfie could slick it with spittle for TV. (Maybe his girlfriend didn't get enough of a raise.) Like W., Wolfie is dangerous precisely because he's so persuaded of his own virtue.Just as Ms. Riza stood behind her man on the Iraq fiasco, so Meghan O'Sullivan stood behind W.Ms. O'Sullivan, a bright and lovely 37-year-old redhead who is the deputy national security adviser, is part of the cordon of adoring and protective women around the president, including Condi, Harriet Miers, Karen Hughes and Fran Townsend.Even though her main experience was helping Paul Bremer set up the botched Iraq occupation and getting a reputation back in Washington ''for not knowing how much she didn't know,'' as George Packer put it in ''The Assassins' Gate,'' Ms. O'Sullivan was promoted nearly two years ago to be the highest-ranking White House official working exclusively on Iraq and Afghanistan.It was clear that she was out of her depth, lacking the heft to deal with the Pentagon and State Department, or the seniority to level with W. ''Meghan-izing the problem'' became a catchphrase in Baghdad for papering over chaos with five-point presentations.But W. was comfortable with Meghan, and Meghan-izing, so he reckoned that a young woman who did not report directly to him or even have the power to issue orders to agencies could be in charge of an epic bungle, just as he thought Harriet Miers could be on the Supreme Court.This vacuum in leadership spawned the White House plan to create a powerful war czar to oversee Iraq and Afghanistan, who could replace Ms. O'Sullivan when she leaves. The push to finally get the A-team on the case is laughably, tragically late.The Washington Post reported that at least five retired four-star generals have refused to be considered; the paper quoted retired Marine Gen. Jack Sheehan as saying, ''The very fundamental issue is, they don't know where the hell they're going.'' I couldn't have said it better myself.Op-Ed ColumnistThere have been many tender love stories in war.Ike and Kay. Pamela Harriman and Edward R. Murrow. Aeneas and Dido. Achilles and his tent temptation, Patroclus.But my favorite is the unfolding saga of Wolfie and Shaha. Never has a star-crossed romance so perfectly illuminated a star-crossed conflict.The weekend meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were consumed with the question of how the bank chief could fight corruption while indulging in cronyism. Who could focus on a weak yen when you had a weak Wolfie with a strong yen for Shaha?In addition to the story about Paul Wolfowitz's giving his girlfriend, Shaha Ali Riza, a promotion and a $60,000 raise because he felt guilty that she had to be transferred from the World Bank to the State Department when he took over, The Times reported yesterday on more imperialist hanky-panky.Steven Weisman and David Sanger wrote that in 2003, when Wolfie was No. 2 at the Pentagon, the office of his consigliere, Douglas Feith, directed a private contractor to hire Ms. Riza, then at the World Bank, to spend a month traveling in Iraq to study ways to set up the new government.(It was simple to get the contractor, the Science Applications International Corporation, to play along. As Vanity Fair reported, the Pentagon awarded SAIC seven contracts valued at more than $100 million before the war, without competitive bidding. Mr. Feith's deputy was Christopher Henry, a former SAIC senior vice president.)Wolfie and Shaha did not let a little thing like World Bank rules -- which barred the bank from providing economic assistance to an area under military occupation -- keep them from pushing the neocon delusions.When she returned, Ms. Riza briefed members of the executive board of the World Bank on her trip, giving them a sanguine account of Iraq's future and the fate of women there.''The bank was under a lot of pressure at the time to do something in Iraq very quickly,'' Jean-Louis Sarbib, a former bank vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, told The Times. But some of the bank's directors, he said, were ''very concerned about why she was briefing the board, under which authority and with whom she had gone there. I did not know anything about this at the time, and I was the vice president, and she was reporting to me.''As they rushed to war, the neocons delighted in blowing off international treaties, international institutions and diplomats, treating them as impediments and whiners. So it only made sense that Wolfie wouldn't hesitate to blow off rules he didn't like once he began running an international institution himself.Sometimes you've got to break some rules and tell some half-truths to help the world.Despite fears among the bank's member governments that Wolfie's smug and stupid behavior is impairing the bank's credibility, he has dug in his heels and said he will stay put. The president has backed him up.Astonishingly, W., Wolfie, Dick Cheney and the Prince of Darkness himself, Richard Perle, have learned nothing from their mistakes of blindness and hubris, except to sweep them under the bed and indulge in more blindness and hubris.In a chapter shown last night of the PBS series ''America at a Crossroads,'' Mr. Perle chatted with Pat Buchanan, his old colleague from the Reagan administration, arguing that America should ignore naysayers and work for regime change in Iran.''There's got to be some advantage to being a superpower,'' Mr. Perle said grandly.Asked by Bob Schieffer on ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday whether the administration had a credibility problem, given the problems with Alberto Gonzales, the optimistic statements about the death spiral in Iraq and the perjury conviction of Scooter Libby, the vice president replied, ''You do the best you can with what you've got, obviously,'' an echo of Rummy's famous ''You go to war with the Army you have.''In America last week to promote a book about the occupation of Iraq, Ayad Allawi, Iraq's former prime minister and failed U.S. puppet, told a group at the Council on Foreign Relations that the Bush administration had invaded an ''imagined'' country.The Financial Times reported Mr. Allawi as saying that ''the Iraqi exiles who advised the U.S. war planners described the country of their memories. Sadly, the Iraq with a solid infrastructure, a solid middle class and a secular tradition had ended 'decades ago.' ''Shouldn't Rummy and Cheney have followed their own advice: You go to war against the country you have, not the one you imagine?Op-Ed ColumnistCorrection:  April 19, 2007, Thursday  Due to a fact-checking error, in some editions of Wednesday's Times, Maureen Dowd's column cited the wrong former Iraqi official as critical of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. He was Ali Allawi, the former finance minister, not Ayad Allawi, the former prime minister.Whether or not the country is ready to elect a woman president or a black president, it's definitely not ready for a metrosexual in chief.In presidential politics, it's all but impossible to put the man into manicure. Be sensitive, but not soft. Effete is never effective. Not much has changed since George H. W. Bush drove his New Hampshire campaign off the road by requesting ''a splash'' more coffee at a truck stop.John Kerry sank himself by windsurfing in spandex and ordering a cheese steak in Philly with Swiss instead of Cheez Whiz.We haven't reached the point where we can handle a green-tea-soy-latte-drinking, self-tanning-sea-salt-mango-body-wrapping, Norah-Jones-listening, yoga-toning chief executive.Bill Clinton sometimes flirted with metrosexuality, with Zegna ties, Christophe haircuts, Donna Karan suits and keen anima, but the heterosexual beat out the metrosexual.Americans have revered such homely leaders as Abe Lincoln. They seem open to balding pates like Rudy's and flattops like Jon Tester's. They don't want self-confidence to look like self-love.John Edwards has reminded us that even -- or especially -- in the age of appearances, you must not appear to care too much about appearances.When you spend more on a couple of haircuts than Burundi's per capita G.D.P. , it looks so vain it makes Paul Wolfowitz's ablutions spitting on his comb look like rugged individualism.Following his star turn primping his hair for two minutes on a YouTube video to the tune of ''I Feel Pretty,'' Mr. Edwards this week had to pay back the $800 charged to his campaign for two shearings at Torrenueva Hair Designs in Beverly Hills. He seems intent on proving that he is a Breck Girl -- and a Material Boy.He did not pony up for the pricey bills from Designworks Salon in Dubuque, Iowa, or the Pink Sapphire spa in Manchester, which offers services for men that include the ''Touch of Youth'' facial, as well as trips ''into the intriguing world of makeup.'' The Edwards campaign calls makeup a legitimate expense.Speaking of roots, my dad, a police detective who was in charge of Senate security, got haircuts at the Senate barbershop for 50 cents. He cut my three brothers' hair and did the same for anyone else in the neighborhood who wanted a free clip job. Even now, Mr. Edwards could get his hair cut at the Senate barbershop for $21 or the Chapel Hill Barber Shop near his campaign headquarters for $16.So it's hard for me to understand how a guy could spend $400 without getting Bergdorf Blonde highlights. (The tabloids claim that Brad and Jen used to get matching streaks.) And don't campaign donors get snippy about sponsoring tonsorial treats?Someone who aspires to talk credibly about the two Americas can't lavish on his locks what working families may spend on electricity in a year. You can't sell earnestness while indulging in decadence.Mr. Edwards, the son of a mill worker, moved from a $5.2 million, six-bedroom Federal mansion in Georgetown to a 28,000-square-foot behemoth in North Carolina with a basketball court, a squash court, two stages and a swimming pool.His 25-year-old daughter, Cate, a former editorial assistant for Vanity Fair, co-founded Urbanista, an online Rolodex that dispenses advice for ''hip'' girls in Manhattan, offering to be a ''bestie'' (a best friend) and answer questions like ''Where should I go to get my Marc Jacobs shoes reheeled?'' and ''Does anyone know the best place to get a really great haircut?'' One salon the site recommends is Warren-Tricomi, where Edward Tricomi says haircuts range from $121 to $300.The cost of grooming hair is peanuts compared with the cost of grooming an image. Hillary is paying a fortune to try to buy the secrets of likability. Her financial reports for the first three months of 2007 show debts to consulting firms of $447,000.John McCain, who's supposed to be giving it to us straight, has a jaw-dropping herd of consultants to tell him how to do that. Dubbed ''the 2007 Full Employment Act for Campaign Consultants,'' the McCain crew spent $645,000 on fund-raising consultants in the first quarter and $400,000 on political consultants in key states (four in South Carolina alone). His top political adviser, John Weaver, got more than $60,000 in just three months.Obviously, there's a lot of waste in political campaigns. But you don't have to be as flinty as Mitt Romney -- who has made his staff triple up at cheap hotels -- to know there's something special about throwing away money on vanity.All the haircuts in the world may not save John Edwards from a blowout.Op-Ed ColumnistUsually, I love the dynamics of a cheeky woman puncturing the ego of a cocky guy.I liked it in '40s movies, and I liked it with Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel, and Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis in ''Moonlighting.''So why don't I like it with Michelle and Barack?I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal -- a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god.The tweaking takes place at fundraisers, where Michelle wants to lift the veil on their home life a bit and give the folks their money's worth.At the big Hollywood fund-raiser for Senator Obama in February, Michelle came on strong.''I am always a little amazed at the response that people get when they hear from Barack,'' she told the crowd at the Beverly Hilton, as her husband stood by looking like a puppy being scolded, reported Hud Morgan of Men's Vogue. ''A great man, a wonderful man. But still a man.''I have some difficulty reconciling the two images I have of Barack Obama. There's Barack Obama the phenomenon. He's an amazing orator, Harvard Law Review, or whatever it was, law professor, best-selling author, Grammy winner. Pretty amazing, right?''And then there's the Barack Obama that lives with me in my house, and that guy's a little less impressive. For some reason this guy still can't manage to put the butter up when he makes toast, secure the bread so that it doesn't get stale, and his 5-year-old is still better at making the bed than he is.''She said that the TV version of Barack Obama sounded really interesting and that she'd like to meet him sometime.Many people I talked to afterward found Michelle wondrous. But others worried that her chiding was emasculating, casting her husband -- under fire for lacking experience -- as an undisciplined child.At a March fund-raiser in New York, she tweaked her husband for not ''putting his socks actually in the dirty clothes.''And at a lunch last week with Chicago women, she gave the candidate a fed-up look about that melting butter and said, ''I'm like: 'You're just asking for it. You know I'm giving a speech about you today.' ''She throws in nice stuff, too, about how he's ''the real deal'' and a trustworthy ''brother.'' But this princess of South Chicago, a formidable Princeton and Harvard Law School grad, wants us to know that she's not polishing the pedestal.The Chicago Tribune profile of ''Barack's Rock'' on Sunday noted that her career had caused her husband discomfort: ''Critics have pointed out that her income has risen along with her husband's political ascent. She sits on the board of a food company that supplies Wal-Mart, which Sen. Obama has denounced for its labor practices.''The Obamas are both skeptical of hype. Michelle dryly told a reporter at her husband's Senate swearing-in that perhaps someday, he would do something to earn all the attention he was getting.But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam J.F.K. into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffins. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk the mystique?Besides, the coolly detached candidate, striving to seem substantive, is good at turning down the heat himself. He manages to tamp down crowds dying to be electrified. He resists surfing his own wave of excitement.Michelle conveys the appealing idea that she will tell her husband when he's puffed up or out of line. She aims high -- she ordered her husband to stop puffing on cigarettes as he started campaigning. But then, why didn't she see the red flags on the Rezko deal?In order to get a bigger yard for their new house on Chicago's South Side in 2005, the Obamas got into what the senator now confesses was a ''boneheaded'' real estate arrangement with a sleazy political dealmaker named Tony Rezko, who has been indicted on influence-peddling charges.On Monday, The Chicago Sun-Times reported more shady Rezko news: ''Obama, who has worked as a lawyer and a legislator to improve living conditions for the poor, took campaign donations from Rezko even as Rezko's low-income housing empire was collapsing, leaving many African-American families in buildings riddled with problems,'' from a lack of heat to no lack of drug dealers and squatters.Mr. Obama riposted that ''it wasn't brought to my attention.'' But isn't that where a dazzling, tough, smart and connected wife could help a guy out?Op-Ed ColumnistPoor Slam Dunk.Not since Madame Butterfly has anyone been so cruelly misunderstood and misused. Slam Dunk says that when he pantingly told the president that fetching information on Saddam's W.M.D. would be a cinch, he did not mean let's go to war.No matter how eager Slam Dunk was to tell W. what he wanted to hear while polishing the president's shoes, the intelligence they craved did not exist. ''Let me say it again: C.I.A. found absolutely no linkage between Saddam and 9/11,'' the ex-Head Spook writes in his new book, self-effacingly titled ''At the Center of the Storm.'' Besides, Junior and Darth had already decided to go to war to show the Arabs their moxie.The president and vice president wanted Slam Dunk to help them dramatize the phony case. Everyone had to pitch in! That Saturday session in December 2002 in the Oval Office was ''essentially a marketing meeting,'' Slam Dunk writes, just for ''sharpening the arguments.''Hey, I feel better.Slam Dunk always presented himself as the ultimate guy's guy, a cigar-chomping spymaster who swapped jokes with the president. But now he shows us his tender side, a sniveling C.I.A. chief bullied by ''remote'' Condi.He says Condi panicked in October 2002 and made him call a Times reporter, Alison Mitchell, who covered the Congressional debate about invading Iraq. In essence, he hypocritically told Alison to disregard the conclusions of his own agency, which had said that the links between Saddam and terrorist groups were tenuous, and that Saddam would take the extreme step of joining with Islamic fanatics only if he thought the U.S. was about to attack him. His nose growing as long as his cigar, he said nothing in the C.I.A. report contradicted the president's case for war.''In retrospect,'' Slam writes, ''I shouldn't have talked to the New York Times reporter at Condi's request. By making public comments in the middle of a contentious political debate, I gave the impression that I was becoming a partisan player.''Can't a guy be a lickspittle without being an ideologue?There were so many nasties trying to push Slam around: Vice, of course, and Wolfie, and Wolfie's neoconcubine Doug Feith. Once, Slam writes, Wolfie ''hounded'' a C.I.A. briefer to translate the diary of Abu Zubaydah, a captured Al Qaeda official, even though the C.I.A. had decided it was just misogynistic ramblings ''about what he wanted to do with women.'' Oh, that sexy beast Wolfie. Look out, Shaha!But even though he was paid a $4 million advance to settle scores, Slam can't turn on W. Maybe it's the Medal of Freedom. ''In a way, President Bush and I are much alike,'' he writes. ''We sometimes say things from our gut, whether it's his 'bring 'em on' or my 'slam dunk.' I think he gets that about me, just as I get that about him.'' (He had me at ''slam dunk.'')The worst meanie was horrid Bob Woodward. Slam socialized with Bob and gave him lots of intel for his best sellers, but then Bob ''painted a caricature of me leaping into the air and simulating a slam dunk, not once but twice, with my arms flailing. Credit Woodward's source with  a fine sense of how to make me look ridiculous, but don't credit him or her with a deep sense of obligation to the truth.''A deep sense of obligation to the truth is something Slam keenly understands, even though he scurried around like the butler in ''Remains of the Day,'' trying to toadie up to the president while, as he belatedly admits, W. was going to invade Iraq without debate or a casus belli.He says the C.I.A. warned Paul Bremer that demobilizing the Iraqi Army would be ''madness.''The two worst intelligence disasters in our history happened on his watch, but Slam says he was Cassandra. He says he gave intel to guys who wanted to ignore or warp it and make bad policy. What could he do?A C.I.A. paper was given to the president's national security team in September 2002 to sum up the possible negatives of invading Iraq, including anarchy and a breakup of Iraq, instability in the neighborhood, a surge of terrorism against U.S. interests, oil disruptions, and seething allies.But it was discreetly tucked away in the back of the briefing book, after the stuff at the beginning about how great it would be to liberate Iraq and end threats to Iraq's neighbors, and the stuff in the middle about reforming Iraq's bureaucracy.Slam gives tips to others who want to engage in public service, including: Don't forget that there are no private conversations, even in the Oval Office. Another might be: If you worry about your own survival more than your country's, you might end up as the whiny fall guy.Op-Ed ColumnistInstead of George Tenet teaching at Georgetown University, George Tenet should be taught at Georgetown University.There should be a course on government called ''The Ultimate Staff Guy.'' A morality saga about how much harm you can do as a go-along, get-along guy, spending so much time trying not to alienate the big cheese so he doesn't can you that you miss the moment when you have to can him or lose your soul.If Colin Powell and George Tenet had walked out of the administration in February 2003 instead of working together on that tainted U.N. speech making the bogus case for war, they might have turned everything around. They might have saved the lives and limbs of all those brave U.S. kids and innocent Iraqis, not to mention our world standing and national security.It would certainly have been harder for timid Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and John Edwards, to back up the administration if two members of the Bush inner circle had broken away to tell an increasingly apparent truth: that Dick Cheney, Rummy and the neocons were feverishly pushing a naïve president into invading Iraq with junk facts.General Powell counted on Slam Dunk -- a slender reed -- to help him rid the speech of most of the garbage the Cheney office wanted in it. Slam, of course, tried to have it both ways, helping the skeptical secretary of state and pandering to higher bosses. Afterward, when the speech turned out to be built on a no-legged stool, General Powell was furious at Slam. But they both share blame: they knew better. They put their loyalty to a runaway White House ahead of their loyalty to a fearful public.Slam Dunk's book tour is mesmerizing, in a horrifying way.''The irony of the whole situation is, is he was bluffing,'' Slam said of Saddam on ''Larry King Live'' on Monday night, adding, ''And he didn't know we weren't.'' Mr. He-Man Tenet didn't understand the basics of poker, much less Arab culture. It never occurred to him that Saddam might feign strength to flex muscles at his foes in the Middle East? Slam couldn't take some of that $40 billion we spend on intelligence annually and get a cultural profile of the dictator before we invaded?If he was really running around with his hair on fire, knowing the Osama danger, shouldn't he have set off alarms when W. and Vice went after Saddam instead of the real threat?Many people in Washington snorted at his dramatic cloak-and-dagger description of himself to Larry King: ''I worked in the shadows my whole life.''He was not Jason Bourne, lurking in dangerous locales. He risked life and limb on Capitol Hill among the backstabbers and cutthroat bureaucrats -- from whom he obviously learned a lot. He spent nine years on the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, four as staff director. When Bill Clinton appointed him to run the C.I.A. in 1997, the profile of him in The Times was headlined ''A Time to Reap the Rewards of Being Loyal.'' It observed that old colleagues had said ''he had an ability to make many different superiors feel at ease with him.''Six former C.I.A. officials sent Mr. Tenet a letter via his publisher -- no wonder we're in trouble if spooks can't figure out the old Head Spook's home address -- berating him for pretending he wrote his self-serving book partly to defend the honor of the agency and demanding that ''at least half'' of the profits be given to wounded soldiers and the families of dead soldiers (there needs to be a Son of Slam law). One of the signers, Larry Johnson, told CNN that Slam ''is profiting from the blood of American soldiers.''''By your silence you helped build the case for war,'' the former C.I.A. officials wrote. ''You betrayed the C.I.A. officers who collected the intelligence that made it clear that Saddam did not pose an imminent threat. You betrayed the analysts who tried to withstand the pressure applied by Cheney and Rumsfeld.''They also said, ''Although C.I.A. officers learned in late September 2002 from a high-level member of Saddam Hussein's inner circle that Iraq had no past or present contact with Osama bin Laden and that the Iraqi leader considered Bin Laden an enemy  you still went before Congress in February 2003 and testified that Iraq did indeed have links to Al Qaeda.''In the end you allowed suspect sources, like Curveball, to be used based on very limited reporting and evidence.'' They concluded that ''your tenure as head of the C.I.A. has helped create a world that is more dangerous.  It is doubly sad that you seem still to lack an adequate appreciation of the enormous amount of death and carnage you have facilitated.''Thus endeth the lesson in our class on ''The Ultimate Staff Guy.'' If you have something deadly important to say, say it when it matters, or just shut up and slink off.Op-Ed ColumnistIt's hard not to be drawn to a presidential candidate with a name like a Bond girl, a smile like an angel, a figure that looks great in a bikini at 53, a campaign style like Joan of Arc, and a buffet for the press corps brimming with crustless fromage sandwiches, icy chocolate profiteroles, raspberry parfaits, red Bordeaux, espresso and little almond gâteaux. (When in France, let us eat cake.)Ségolène Royal brought back the sizzle to socialism, raising the ire of Stephen Colbert's right-wing TV host, who warned that ''socialism is always a threat but never more so than when it looks like this.''At first, Ségolène seemed like the ideal candidate for a country that knew it needed change but didn't really want change, because she looked like change but wasn't really going to change anything. But the infatuation dampened, like a spring romance.I entered the Ségosphere, as her supporters call it, Thursday evening in Lille, for the last big rally -- and perhaps last hurrah -- of her ''serene revolution,'' as it's dubbed.The unmarried mother of four and daughter of a misogynistic army colonel entered the factorylike hall to a militant techno beat, gliding through the cheering crowd of 20,000 with a radiant smile and bright red jacket. Supporters, including many young ethnic Arab men and older women in head scarves up front, strained to touch and pat her.On stage, she channeled a divine aura, levitating her arms like a Blessed Virgin statue, presenting herself as a glowing beacon against the forces of darkness, a k a Nicolas Sarkozy. In the Ségosphere, the right-wing front-runner is a brute, Rudy Giuliani without the restraint, while she is a healer. She consciously casts herself as Marianne, the symbol of France -- playing ''La Marseillaise'' at rallies -- but comes across more like Marianne Williamson, the New Age spirituality guru, going for the chakra vote.''What I want, it's for everybody to unleash this energy they feel within themselves,'' she said, ''but this energy that is sometimes curbed, curbed by so many blockages, curbed by so many negative speeches, curbed by so many shadows.  It is not the dark side that I want to awake. It is the side of light, it is the side of hope, it is the part of joy, it is the part of smile, it is the part of France that loves itself as it is.''Even though her strategy of playing the woman card fell flat, she kept it up in her last week. In Lille, she said she knew some wondered: ''Is it really reasonable to choose a woman? Is France going to dare? I want to say: Dare. Dare! You won't regret it.''Ségo is bolder than the cautious Hillary, but stumbles into mistakes more often; unlike Hillary, she has not done her homework on foreign policy. Ségo blends a fierce will and feminine style more deftly than Hillary, but is also seen as somewhat cold, porcelain under her porcelain skin, rather than seductive, like Bill Clinton.Ségo showed verve and grit in her self-professed role as a ''gazelle'' darting past the sexist old Socialist elephants -- not to mention the father of her children, François Hollande, the head of her party, who wanted to run himself. Though Mr. Hollande supports Ségo, she does not seem as dependent as Hillary on getting her man to push people around for her.France is chauvinistic -- women got the vote in 1944 and compose only a small percentage of the National Assembly -- but the country seems less neurotic than America about the idea of a woman as president. The trouble with Ségo's campaign is not her gender. The trouble is that her only vision for France is herself. Hence, her nickname: Egolene.A Sarko adviser called Ségo ''a very pretty gadget'' who looked modern but had no real plan to move France out of malaise and into the future.When Ségo lost her temper at Sarko during Wednesday's debate, on the issue of disabled children's going to regular schools, it was denounced as contrived and inaccurate. She wanted to seem assertive and goad her abrasive and volatile rival into boiling over. Instead, he pushed the gender card back, telling her to ''calm down'' and stereotyping Serene Ségo as too moody and changeable to run a country that likes big, powerful leaders.''She is not in a good mood this morning; it must be the polls,'' he said Friday, after she warned that he was ''a dangerous choice,'' with ''the same neoconservative ideology'' as W., someone who could cause the country to erupt.In a contest between what one Parisian calls ''le fou'' and ''la fausse,'' the crazy and the false, France may say oui to le fou.Op-Ed ColumnistBeauty has been chased off by the Beast.Now France waits to see just how feral and domineering Nicolas Sarkozy will be.The lovely Ségolène Royal -- more phenomenon than politician -- ran a maternal, Manichaean campaign painting her intense, Napoleon-sized opponent as an immoral political animal and a brute whose election would spark riots and ''a sort of civil war.''The luminous Sego did not even deign to address the ''dark'' Sarko by name, either in the debate or in her concession speech Sunday night.Cartoonists have depicted the tough guy -- who bullies rivals, betrays mentors and calls young troublemakers in low-income housing in the Paris suburbs ''scum'' -- as a gargoyle, Dracula, an evil sorcerer and a devil.The imagery of the presidential duel tapped into mythic Gothic tales of France, like ''Beauty and the Beast,'' ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' and ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''With Hungarian, Greek and Jewish roots, with a father who deserted and belittled him, with his jittery ambition and pugnacious talk, Sarko is jolting the inbred, insular and introspective world of elite French politics. The far right has called him ''a foreigner with an unhappy marriage,'' and a Sego adviser scorned him as ''an American neocon with a French passport.''''He's an arriviste,'' said Bruno Ract-Madoux, the owner of a vintage shop in Paris. ''From the beginning, he was someone who would sell his mother as fast as possible to get ahead.''Or as an elegant Parisian woman who voted for Sego warned guests at a postelection dinner party, ''He's like a little Donald Trump.''Sego was serene and protective -- but vague; Sarko was kinetic and pushy -- and concrete. As it turned out, the French wanted to be prodded even more than they wanted to be pampered. Perhaps they have decided they have to stop being sluggish so they can continue to be supercilious.Liberals mocked Sarko's campaign theme: ''A France that wakes up early.'' Gérard Biard wrote a piece in the far-left weekly paper Charlie Hebdo: ''At dawn, I ripped myself out of bed.  I took a cold shower, put on some mismatched socks and downed eight espressos, as I headed out to meet France in the morning.  The France that wakes up early would rather stay in the sack.''But even some who voted for the woman who would have been the first La France Présidente admitted that they did not want their country to calcify. ''Who has a 35-hour workweek?'' said Phillippe Rosenthal, who sells leather chairs.Sarko wrote in his political book ''Testimony'' that France ''is not a museum'' and ''must find the energy'' to succeed. In his acceptance speech, he said he would ''rehabilitate'' work, and an adviser promised he would be ''a presidential entrepreneur.'' (Just as soon as he comes back from his yachting vacation.)One expatriate friend of mine observed that the French are not lazy, they just want a leisurely lunch.At a Paris flea market on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, the vendors did not eat fast food or takeout at lunchtime. They set up tables with tablecloths, china and crystal and joined other vendors to dine on whole roasted chicken, fresh salad, bread and wine. And some would not interrupt their meal even for shoppers who wanted to buy their wares.When I was reading newspapers during lunch at a Left Bank hotel, the maître d' approached. ''You're a journalist,'' he pleasantly accused me, implying that only such a robotic American creature could work while eating. He had a point. Nearby, in the lobby, Catherine Deneuve was having fun, smoking and drinking wine with girlfriends surrounded by Chanel bags full of Chanel bags.They do not want the joie to go out of de vivre, but the French are not averse to being whipped into shape by drill sergeant Sarko. They want the fireplug to plug France into modern capitalism. The French sphinx should bound past the Celtic tiger.''He wants to make people work and make more money,'' said one French professional woman I know. ''The French are like children who love to be beaten. Sarkozy is saying, 'Go do your homework or I'll beat you.' The French need to be told that.''It will be fascinating to watch Sarko try to discipline the French, and change their psychology about work. Or will they discipline him, burrowing into their Camembert cocoon, chasing him away as he did Sego?The mood here was best summed up with a take on an old Bette Davis line. Jean d'Ormesson, a commentator in Le Figaro, advised: ''Fasten your seatbelts. This will be quite a ride.''Op-Ed ColumnistGordon Brown's smile does not look at home on his face. It sits there uneasily, like an uninvited guest at a party, until his features can resume their comfortably dour grooves.The brooding Scot ended his decade-long run as a hefty Heathcliff to Tony Blair's chatty Cathy, stepping out of the shadows Friday with visible relief to begin a campaign for prime minister that he has already won.Grumpy Gordon is an enigma compared with Captain Showbiz, as the glib Mr. Blair is called by a morning TV host here. The 56-year-old son of a Presbyterian minister, with hooded eyes and frugal charm, will be hard pressed to compete on the European stage with Iron Frau Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, dubbed ''Thatcher without petticoats.''Mr. Brown's school friends came on TV to say he was more fun than he looked. ''He enjoys a good glass of wine,'' said his pal Bill Campbell.The chancellor has been striving to move beyond his reputation as a man so obsessed with the budget that he wouldn't even share the details in advance with Tony Blair. He traded the green eyeshade for pastel ties. He told a women's magazine that he liked the rock band Arctic Monkeys, but later couldn't name any of their songs.Mr. Brown was considered the uncool half of the Cool Britannia team that swept into power on a wave of Champagne, celebrities and Cherie Blair's New Age guru. But thanks to his role as W.'s interlocutor and translator, Tony Blair is uncool, too.The first boomer prime minister got a blazing start in trying to make Britain more modern and tolerant. But he fell in with an American crowd of bullies who were turning back the clock on modernity and tolerance, and Tony abused Britons' trust.Growing fearful that he would inherit a bankrupt franchise, Grumpy decided this was his ''nobody puts Baby in a corner'' moment. The frowning apprentice gave the drowning prime minister a shove out of Downing Street. Maybe the last straw was the movie ''The Queen,'' chronicling Mr. Blair's political finesse after Princess Diana's death. It mentions Mr. Brown in passing, when Tony is too busy to take Gordon's call and tells an aide to put him on hold.Grumpy let Tony take the lead 13 years ago, believing Tony would hand off power to him eventually. While Mr. Brown felt intellectually superior, he knew his media skills were wanting. They still are. His debut was, as the BBC put it, ''a bit of a hash.''He got an uninspiring £100 haircut, which was ''lost on everyone,'' as one reporter dryly put it. Arriving for a photo-op breakfast at a supporter's home in Southgate, the door slammed and locked on him, leaving him ringing the bell as cameras rolled. Once inside, he tried to talk to a blond little girl, but initially she froze him out. During his big speech, a teleprompter obscured his face, and he faded into a bland beige background. On top of that, Tony Blair chose that hour to attend a ceremony unveiling a statue of a soccer star, so news channels had to split the screens for part of Mr. Brown's speech -- a visual reminder of their tortured Lennon-and-McCartney partnership.The Odd Couple had periods of not speaking, and Mr. Brown's disdain for Mr. Blair's style showed. ''I have never believed presentation should be a substitute for policy,'' he said. ''I do not believe politics is about celebrity.'' He dropped the New Labor logo from the Labor Web site. He promised to restore power to Parliament to rebuild trust in democracy -- a knock on the way Mr. Blair ignored public opinion to invade Iraq -- and to give more protection to civil liberties.Mr. Blair's defensive yet defiant resignation speech was elaborately stage-managed, with spinners fanning out afterward to puff up his legacy, even though, despite the remarkable achievements of Kosovo and Northern Ireland, his legacy will be buried in the blood and sand of Iraq with W's. The speech set off a torrent of contempt about the era of spin he had introduced, with critics saying it had rotted discourse. The expert spin that helped him win three elections was also used to raise fears over Saddam's phantom W.M.D. TV played the clip over and over in which Mr. Blair said Saddam had W.M.D. that could be activated in 45 minutes, but the former Blair consigliere Peter Mandelson asserted that Tony didn't want an ally to have to go to war alone.On Friday, the commentators began to fret that Mr. Brown needed more spin. How would he fare against the young conservative David Cameron, known as Blair Lite, if he couldn't get the teleprompter out of his face, or keep his pant leg out of his sock?Was he too old? Could he wear the bottoms of his trousers rolled?Op-Ed ColumnistThe French can be very, well, French when it comes to the personal lives of their leaders.They take affairs, illegitimate children and tumultuous marriages in stride.But they suddenly turn traditional when it comes to the role of the first lady. They do not like the idea of Nicolas Sarkozy entertaining world leaders alone at the Élysée Palace. It is not comme il faut.Maybe that's why this country is so mesmerized with the question of whether the beautiful Cécilia Sarkozy, a former Schiaparelli model who was for years her husband's influential political adviser, is going to serve as the chatelaine of the Élysée, or run off again with a lover.No one seems sure if she will bolt, leaving the entertaining duties to Sarko's mother, an elegant lawyer, or agree to play a limited role at the palace.''We have a hard time imagining an intermittent first lady at the Élysée,'' sniffed Le Temps, a daily newspaper, online.Cécilia was missing in action during the final weeks of her husband's campaign. ''I don't see myself as first lady,'' the 49-year-old said. ''That bores me.''Bound by strict privacy laws, and cozy with the elite ruling class, the French press shies away from printing the skinny on relationships, even though the skinny French public loves gossiping on the subject.Trying to fathom what is going on with power couples here is like watching a French movie -- scenes brimming with emotion and ambiguity.Cécilia left Sarko for several months in 2005, moving to America to live with a French events organizer -- reportedly a response to her husband's affair with a French journalist.When Paris Match published pictures of Cécilia with her lover in New York, Sarko became furious with his good friend, Arnaud Lagardère, the magazine's owner. Soon, the editor was fired.Mr. Lagardère stepped in again to kill a story in another publication he owns, Le Journal du Dimanche. On Sunday, the paper was going to reveal that Cécilia did not bother to vote.On the night Sarko won the presidency, Parisians were watching Cécilia's every move. She was not there when he won or when he made his acceptance speech, and some of her friends were saying that the marriage was over.But her two pretty blonde daughters from a previous marriage apparently prevailed on her to show up later that night at a victory rally. She came dressed down in a gray sweater and white slacks, in what one friend said had originally been her ''escape outfit,'' and looked distracted as her husband spoke, plucking at her sweater.At the post-rally party, Paris Match -- now following the Sarko script -- was given an exclusive on their happy reunion. They were in a hotel suite, the magazine said, behaving ''like lovers.''''And the new president, regaining for an instant the taste of rhythm that invaded him in his youth, took a step in dance,'' the story said. ''In front of all their friends reunited, he dances for a single person: Cécilia.''When Paris isn't fixated on Cécilia and Sarko, it's buzzing about the town's other power couple.As Ségolène Royal tries to build on her strong showing to become the Socialist candidate for president in 2012, her relationship with the father of her four children and the head of her party, François Hollande, grows more byzantine.She brazenly bounded past Mr. Hollande -- who wanted to run himself -- and now she wants to eclipse him totally. This competition -- the opposite of Billary -- certainly did not help her candidacy. ''Every morning I would open the newspapers and ask myself which Socialist was going to attack me over what I was saying,'' she told a party conference the other day.Their relationship is the subject of a new book, ''La Femme Fatale,'' by two respected political reporters from Le Monde. The couple is suing to have some passages cut.''Disappointed in her private life, she chose to go into battle without worrying anymore about François Hollande, but also with the assertion that she was more popular than him, and he hadn't been able to renovate the Socialist Party despite hopes of party activists and elected officials,'' Raphaëlle Bacqué, a co-author, told a journalist, noting that the fact that Sego and Mr. Hollande were at each other's throats, while keeping their status a mystery, had ''serious political consequences. They should have been unbeatable.  him at the head of the party, her a candidate. But instead we saw two teams in endless competition.''The book quotes an interview in which Mr. Hollande was asked where he would live if Sego won. ''At my house!'' he replied.Op-Ed ColumnistPaul Wolfowitz may be out of a job soon, but think of what an amazing résumé he'll be shopping around:Work ExperiencePresident of World Bank: 2005-2007Responsibilities: Reining in European lefties, raining tax-free money on Arab girlfriend, and giving anti-corruption efforts a bad name.Achievements: Paralyzed the international lending apparatus to the point where small countries had to max out their Visa cards to pay for malaria medicine. Learned the traditions of many cultures, including those of Turkey, where you apparently are not supposed to take off your shoes at mosques to reveal socks so full of holes that both big toes poke blasphemously through.Deputy Secretary of Defense for President George W. Bush: 2001-2005Responsibility: Starting a war.Achievements: Mismanaged the world's most powerful army. Shattered the system of international diplomacy that kept the peace for 50 years. Undermined the credibility of American intelligence operations. Needlessly brought humankind to the brink of nuclear war. Destroyed Iraq.Demented Visionary: 1993-2001Responsibility: Concocting a delusional plan for regime change in Iraq with pals like Shaha Riza, Ahmad Chalabi and his merry band of Iraqi exiles who conjured up phony intelligence about Saddam's W.M.D.Achievements: Imagining an Iraq that didn't exist.Having Wolfie back on the job market is a tremendous opportunity. What do we want destroyed next? Could this walking curse on the world run Halliburton into the ground?At the Pentagon, Wolfie tried to help Vice get rid of anything multi -- multilateral treaties, multilateral institutions, multilateral alliances, multiculturalism. Multi, to them, meant wobbly, caviling, bureaucratic and obstructionist. Why be multi when you could be uni?In the end, the forces of multilateralism took their revenge: Old Europe got rid of Wolfie.But not before his gal pal played the multicultural victim card. In her statement to World Bank directors, Shaha complained that she had been denied promotions even before Wolfie got there. ''I can only attribute this to discrimination -- not because I am a woman, but because I am a Muslim Arab woman who dares to question the status quo both in the work of the institution and within the institution itself,'' Shaha wrote.She said that she had ''met a wonderful American woman who told me that I should fight back for 'us': WOMEN. It never occurred to me as an Arab and Muslim woman that one day I would be asked by an American woman to fight on her behalf.''Already aggrieved, Shaha got really furious when Wolfie came in 2005 and she was told she'd have to work out of the State Department.''I was ready to pursue legal remedies,'' she wrote in her statement, adding, ''my life and career were torn asunder.''According to Xavier Coll, the bank's human resources vice president, Shaha outlined conditions for her departure that were ''unprecedented'' in terms of guarantees and rewards and way out of line with bank policy. Mr. Coll deemed it ''inappropriate and imprudent for the president to offer Ms. Riza these terms.''Bob Bennett, Wolfie's lawyer, told Michael Hirsh of Newsweek that it was Shaha who ''worked up the numbers'' on a $60,000 raise to a $193,590 salary and cushy new deal. ''She was outraged that she had to leave,'' Mr. Bennett said.The self-righteous Shaha played on Wolfie's guilt, becoming ''greedy in terms of power,'' as a friend of the couple told Newsweek. Even though she had been a mere flack a few years ago and then a gender coordinator at the bank, Shaha mau-maued her man into giving her a salary that topped the secretary of state's.It's like when Bill Clinton tells friends that he has to work hard to get Hillary elected president because he feels he owes her for bringing her to Arkansas in the 70s and interrupting her career. (But do we?)Or when Tony Soprano gets Carmela some fancy piece of jewelry after he strays. Indeed, Wolfie sounded Sopranoish when he agitatedly told Mr. Coll to warn those at the bank he believed were attacking him: ''If they  #! with me or Shaha, I have enough on them to  #! them, too.''Wolfie used public compensation for private contrition. Gilt for guilt -- not a good deal.Op-Ed ColumnistIt's no wonder Al Gore is a little touchy about his weight, what with everyone trying to read his fat cells like tea leaves to see if he's going to run.He was so determined to make his new book look weighty, in the this-treatise-belongs-on-the-shelf-between-Plato-and-Cato sense, rather than the double-chin-isn't-quite-gone-yet sense, that he did something practically unheard of for a politician: He didn't plaster his picture on the front.''The Assault on Reason'' looks more like the Beatles' White Album than a screed against the tinny Texan who didn't get as many votes in 2000.The Goracle does concede a small author's picture on the inside back flap, a chiseled profile that screams Profile in Courage and that also screams Really Old Picture. Indeed, if you read the small print next to the wallet-sized photo of Thin Gore looking out prophetically into the distance, it says it's from his White House years.A subliminal clue to his intentions, perhaps? He must be flattered that many demoralized leading Republicans and Bush insiders think a Gore-Obama ticket would be unbeatable. And he must be gratified that his rival Hillary has never cemented her inevitability, even with Bill Clinton's lip-licking Web video pushing her.But though he's on a book tour clearly timed to build on his Oscar flash and Nobel buzz, and take advantage of the public's curiosity about whether he'll jump in the race, he almost seems to want to sigh and roll his eyes when he's asked about it.''I'm not a candidate,'' he told Diane Sawyer on ''Good Morning America.'' ''This book is not a political book. It's not a candidate book at all.''Of course, his protestation was lost given the fact that he was sitting in front of a screen blaring the message ''The Race to '08,'' and above a crawl that asked ''Will he run for the White House?''He is so fixed on not seeming like a presidential flirt that he risks coming across as a bit of a righteous tease or a high-minded scold, which is exactly what his book is, a high-minded scolding. He upbraided Diane about the graphics for his segment, complaining about buzzwords and saying, ''That's not what this is about.''Diane was not so easily put off as he turned up his nose at the horse race and the vast wasteland of TV, and bored in for the big question: ''Donna Brazile, your former campaign manager, has said, 'If he drops 25 to 30 pounds, he's running.' Lost any weight?''Laughing obligingly, he replied: ''I think, you know, millions of Americans are in the same struggle I am on that one. But look, listen to your questions. And you know, if the horse race, the cosmetic parts of this -- and look, that's all understandable and natural. But while we're focused on, you know, Britney and KFed and Anna Nicole Smith and all this stuff, meanwhile, very quietly, our country has been making some very serious mistakes that could be avoided if we the people, including the news media, are involved in a full and vigorous discussion of what our choices are.''He explained to James Traub of The New York Times Magazine that TV induces a sort of national trance because the brain's fear center, the amygdala, receives only a fraction of electrical impulses from the neocortex, and couldn't resist lecturing about the amygdala -- ''which as I'm sure you know comes from the Latin for 'almond.' ''Mr. Traub said that, as he followed the ex-vice president around, the Goracle was ''eating like a maniac: I watched him inhale the clam dip at a reception like a man who doesn't know when his next meal will be coming.''If Al Gore is really unplugged and uncensored, as Tipper and his fans say, then he is no longer bound by the opinions of gurus, mercenaries and focus groups. He can be himself, and inhale away and still run if he wants.Barack Obama is as slender as an adolescent and exercises constantly, but he still sometimes seems strangely tired on the campaign trail. He blamed fatigue when he overstated the death toll of the Kansas tornadoes, saying it was 10,000 when it was 12.Doug Brinkley, the presidential historian, said that even though the fashion now is for fit candidates, after the Civil War, there was a series of overweight presidents. ''It showed you had a zest for life,'' he said. (The excess baggage may make Bill Clinton and Bill Richardson look roguish, but unfortunately, too many cheeseburgers and ice cream sundaes make Mr. Gore look puffy and waxy.) ''Maybe,'' Mr. Brinkley suggested, ''Gore can sit in Tennessee and do it via high-definition satellite -- like McKinley, just eat and sit on the porch.''Op-Ed ColumnistFor me, the saddest spot in Washington is the inverted V of the black granite Vietnam wall, jutting up with the names of young men dying in a war that their leaders already knew could not be won.So many died because of ego and deceit -- because L.B.J. and Robert McNamara wanted to save face or because Henry Kissinger wanted to protect Nixon's re-election chances.Now the Bush administration finds itself at that same hour of shame. It knows the surge is not working. Iraq is in a civil war, with a gruesome bonus of terrorists mixed in. April was the worst month this year for the American military, with 104 soldiers killed, and there have been about 90 killed thus far in May. The democracy's not jelling, as Iraqi lawmakers get ready to slouch off for a two-month vacation, leaving our kids to be blown up.The top-flight counterinsurgency team that President Bush sent in after long years of pretending that we'd ''turned the corner'' doesn't believe there's a military solution. General Petraeus is reduced to writing an open letter to the Iraqi public, pleading with them to reject sectarianism and violence, even as the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr slinks back from four months in Iran, rallying his fans by crying: ''No, no, no to Satan! No, no, no to America! No, no, no to occupation! No, no, no to Israel!''W. thinks he can save face if he keeps taunting Democrats as the party of surrender -- just as Nixon did -- and dumps the Frankenstate he's created on his successor.''The enemy in Vietnam had neither the intent nor the capability to strike our homeland,'' he told Coast Guard Academy graduates. ''The enemy in Iraq does. Nine-eleven taught us that to protect the American people we must fight the terrorists where they live so that we don't have to fight them where we live.''The president said an intelligence report (which turned out to be two years old) showed that Osama had been trying to send Qaeda terrorists in Iraq to attack America. So clearly, Osama is capable of multitasking: Order the killers in Iraq to go after American soldiers there and American civilians here. There AND here. Get it, W.?The president is on a continuous loop of sophistry: We have to push on in Iraq because Al Qaeda is there, even though Al Qaeda is there because we pushed into Iraq. Our troops have to keep dying there because our troops have been dying there. We have to stay so the enemy doesn't know we're leaving. Osama hasn't been found because he's hiding.The terrorists moved into George Bush's Iraq, not Saddam Hussein's. W.'s ranting about Al Qaeda there is like planting fleurs du mal and then complaining your garden is toxic.The president looked as if he wanted to smack David Gregory when the NBC reporter asked him at the news conference Thursday if he could still be ''a credible messenger on the war'' given all the mistakes and all the disillusioned Republicans.''I'm credible because I read the intelligence, David,'' he replied sharply.But he isn't and he doesn't. Otherwise he might have read ''Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.'' in August 2001, and might have read the prewar intelligence reports the Senate just released that presciently forecast the horrors in store for naïve presidents who race to war because they want to be seen as hard, not soft.Intelligence analysts may have muffed the W.M.D. issue, but they accurately predicted that implanting democracy in Iraq would be an ''alien'' idea that could lead to turbulence and violence; that Al Qaeda would hook up with Saddam loyalists and ''angry young recruits'' to militant Islam to ''wage guerrilla warfare'' on American forces, and that Iran and Al Qaeda would be the winners if the Bushies botched the occupation.W. repeated last week that he would never retreat, but his advisers are working on ways to retreat. After the surge, in lieu of strategy, come the ''concepts.''Condi Rice, Bob Gates and generals at the Pentagon are talking about long-range ''concepts'' for reducing forces in Iraq, The Times reported yesterday, as a way to tamp down criticism, including from Republicans; it is also an acknowledgment that they can't sustain the current force level there much longer. The article said that officials were starting to think about how to halve the 20 American combat brigades in Iraq, sometime in the second half of 2008.As the Hollywood screenwriter said in ''Annie Hall'': ''Right now it's only a notion, but I think I can get money to make it into a concept and later turn it into an idea.''Op-Ed ColumnistThe odd thing is that conservatives wear pinstriped suits. They love the ancients so much that they really should be walking around in togas. The main contribution of the Greeks to modern American politics may have been Michael Dukakis, who once climbed the Acropolis in wingtips.But that doesn't stop conservatives -- especially the Straussians who pushed for going into Iraq -- from being obsessed with ancient Greece, and from believing that they are the successors to Plato and Homer in terms of the lofty ideals and nobility and character in American politics -- while Democrats merely muck about with policies for the needy.Harvey Mansfield, a leading Straussian who taught political science at Harvard and who wrote a book called ''Manliness'' (he's for it), gave the Jefferson lecture recently at the National Endowment for the Humanities in Washington.It was an ode, as his book is, to ''thumos,'' the Greek word that means spiritedness, with flavors of ambition, pride and brute willfulness. Thumos, as Philip Kennicott wrote in The Washington Post, ''is a word reinvented by conservative academics who need to put a fancy name on a political philosophy that boils down to 'boys will be boys.' ''In his prepared remarks, Mr. Mansfield did not mention the war, which is a downer at conclaves of neocons and thumos worshippers. But he explained that thumos is ''the bristling reaction of an animal in face of a threat or a possible threat.'' In thumos, he added, ''we see the animality of man, for men (and especially males) often behave like dogs barking, snakes hissing, birds flapping. But precisely here we also see the humanity of the human animal'' because it is reacting for ''a reason, even for a principle, a cause. Only human beings get angry.''The professor used an example, naturally, from ancient Greece to explain why politics should be about revolution rather than equilibrium: ''What did Achilles do when his ruler Agamemnon stole his slave girl? He raised the stakes. He asserted that the trouble was not in this loss alone but in the fact that the wrong sort of man was ruling the Greeks. Heroes, or at least he-men like Achilles, should be in charge rather than lesser beings like Agamemnon who have mainly their lineage to recommend them and who therefore do not give he-men the honors they deserve. Achilles elevated a civil complaint concerning a private wrong to a demand for a change of regime, a revolution in politics.'' Mr. Mansfield concluded: ''To complain of an injustice is an implicit claim to rule.''The most recent example of the Hellenization of the Bush administration is the president's choice for war czar, Army Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute, who says he loves the Greek military historian Thucydides.Other Thucydides aficionados include Victor Davis Hanson, who was a war-guru to Dick Cheney when the vice president went into the bunker after 9/11 and got into his gloomy Hobbesian phase. (Hobbes's biggest influence was also Thucydides.)Donald Kagan, a respected Yale historian who has written authoritatively on the Peloponnesian War, is the father of Robert Kagan, a neocon who pushed for the Iraq invasion, and Frederick Kagan, a military historian who urged the surge.I called Professor Kagan to ask him if Thucydides, the master at chronicling hubris and imperial overreaching, might provide the new war czar with any wisdom that can help America sort through the morass of Iraq.Very much his sons' father, the classicist said he was disgusted that the White House, after a fiasco of an occupation designed by Rummy, ''is still doing one dumb thing after another'' by appointing General Lute, a chief skeptic of the surge.Professor Kagan said that one reason the Athenians ended up losing the war was because in the Battle of Mantinea in 418 B.C. against the Spartans, they sent ''a very inferior force'' and had a general in command who was associated with the faction that was against the aggressive policy against the Spartans.''Kind of like President Bush appointing this guy to run the war whose strategy is opposed to the surge,'' he said dryly.With cold realism, Thucydides captured the Athenian philosophy in the 27-year war that led to its downfall as a golden democracy: ''The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.''What message can we take away from Thucydides for modern times?''To me,'' Professor Kagan said, ''the deepest message, the most tragic, is his picture of civilization as a very thin veneer. When you punch a hole in it, what you find underneath is hollow, the precivilized characteristics of the human race -- animalistic in the worst possible way.''Compared to Iraq, the Peloponnesian War was a cakewalk.Op-Ed ColumnistWhen Alvy Singer and Annie Hall split up, he tells her a relationship is like a shark: ''It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.''A relationship that turns into a dead shark is common. A live shark that reproduces without a relationship, however, is uncommon. Yet there was a recent report of a virgin birth in an aquarium -- a female shark having a baby without mating. A trick of nature called parthenogenesis.''I love this word parthenogenesis,'' David Page, an expert on sex evolution at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., told me. ''It suggests knowledge, but what it stands for in this case is ignorance. Nobody has a clue how parthenogenesis works.''When a hammerhead shark had a baby at an Omaha zoo, scientists at first thought she had mated with another species or stored sperm from years before. But then they decided there was no ''male contribution,'' as one put it.Dr. Page may be biased in favor of male contribution, but he doubts females are ready to dispense with males. ''It's reproducing without sex, and reproducing with sex is something that's been around on our planet for maybe a billion or a billion and a half years,'' he said. ''Even yeast cells, the cells that make your bread and beer and wine, reproduce sexually.''A shark may know how to knock herself up, but in ''Knocked Up,'' the new Judd Apatow comedy being hailed as ''an era-defining classic'' and a ''zeitgeist-tapping generational marker,'' Katherine Heigl still has to fool with the birds and the bees.She plays a reporter for the E! network who becomes pregnant the old-fashioned way: she gets so drunk with a stranger at a bar that she can't tell he's not using a condom.He's not the perfect man. Played by Seth Rogen, he's a pothead with no income, no cellphone and no muscle tone. He lives in a group house plastered with girlie magazines and littered with ninja weapons. When he and his friends aren't paintballing or trading movie lines or fighting with fiery boxing gloves or obsessing on women's breasts, they plot to start a cinema nudity Web site called Flesh of the Stars. The morning after their tryst, he advises the appalled Ms. Heigl at breakfast: ''Once you're hung over, you've just gotta puke.''On the other hand, he's sweet and honest and sticks by her through her pregnancy, despite ups and downs with her affections, her hormones and her high-maintenance sister. Maybe he is perfect.Ms. Heigl's single working girl decides to keep the baby, just as Natalie Wood's single working girl did in the 1963 ''Love With the Proper Stranger,'' when she becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with a raffish stranger played by Steve McQueen.Even now, after so many decades, it's hard to imagine a romantic-comedy heroine opting for, as one of the slacker dudes puts it, ''a word that rhymes with shmashmortion.''I'm not sure I'd deem ''Knocked Up'' ''a 'Tootsie' or 'The Graduate' for the 21st century,'' as Slate called it. But Mr. Apatow, who specializes in lovable geeks falling in love, is funny.The '30s and '40s had screwball comedies, with the snappy patter of zany dames and the guys they drove crazy. In the '70s, Woody Allen and Diane Keaton made magic.This period will be remembered for classic comedies where the true sparks fly between men -- coming-of-age tales about guys who should already be of age -- perpetual boys with Maxim mind-sets, hilariously knocking on each other (usually by dismissing each other with crude or anatomical terms for women). In his Bilbongsromans, Mr. Apatow cleverly tempers his adolescent raunch with old-fashioned innocence.From Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's ''Zoolander'' to Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn's ''Wedding Crashers'' to Will Ferrell's ''Old School'' and ''Anchorman,'' to Mr. Apatow's ''40-Year-Old Virgin'' and ''Knocked Up,'' the creative energy is with the boys.Mr. Apatow's message is that his lost boys must put their toys away and find the deeper fun in adult responsibility. Suddenly, while having lap dances and taking shrooms in Vegas with his new buddy, Paul Rudd, Mr. Rogen decides to go home, shelve his bong and be a daddy.Mr. Apatow's women are smart and confident, but you always know you are on a journey with the men. Ultimately, the men seem happiest without any female contribution -- when they're engrossed in the gross-out world of guydom. It's like a male version of parthenogenesis.Op-Ed ColumnistIn mythic tales from ''Superman'' to ''Star Wars'' to ''Spider-Man,'' there comes a moment when the young superhero has to learn to harness his powers. That's the challenge Barack Obama faces now.Clearly, the 45-year-old senator is blessed with many gifts. He can write and talk, think and walk, with exceptional grace and agility.When he wants to, Mr. Obama can rouse the crowd to multiple ovations, as he did yesterday when he talked with a preacher's passion about the ''quiet riot'' of frustration of blacks in this country, on issues like Katrina, in a speech before black clergy at Hampton University in Virginia.But often he reverts to Obambi, tentative about commanding the stage and consistently channeling the excitement he engenders. At times, he seems to be actively resisting his phenom status and easy appeals to emotion. When he should fire up, he dampens. When he should dominate, he's deferential. When he should lacerate, he's languid.Futilely, he chafes at the notion that debates and forums are rituals for showing a sense of command with a forceful one-liner, a witty takedown or a ''shining city on a hill'' moment. He keeps trying to treat them as places where he can riff, improvise, soothe, extrapolate or find common ground. He skitters away from the subtext of political contests, the need to use your force to slay your opponents.In the first two Democratic debates and Monday night's forum on faith, Hillary Clinton commanded the stage, just like a great squash player dominates the T. The woman radiated more authority than the glamour boys flanking her -- and she did it despite the pressure of having a few new books published with salacious and unflattering nuggets about her.In the South Carolina debate, Senator Obama was -- absurdly -- taken by surprise when Brian Williams asked the requisite Dukakis question designed to elicit manly passion: How would he respond if Al Qaeda hit two American cities? The senator ignored the visceral nature of the question and rambled on cerebrally about natural disasters, working with the international community and about how he would have to see if there was ''any intelligence on who might have carried it out so that we can take potentially some action to dismantle that network.''He was already told that it was Al Qaeda in the question, and ''potentially,'' ''some'' and ''dismantle'' are not the sort of fast-and-furious words the moment required. A bit later, he doubled back to say he would hunt down terrorists, but it was too late.In the New Hampshire debate Sunday night, Mr. Obama again missed his chances. Hillary is the one he needs to unseat, but he treads gingerly around her. He seems afraid of a repeat of that moment last December, as the clamor for him to run was building, when he touched her elbow and winked at her on the Senate floor, and she kept walking. He called a friend afterwards, stunned at her icy behavior.Instead, he wasted his time tangling with Dennis Kucinich in the first debate and slapping back John Edwards in the second.When Hillary admitted that she had not read the National Intelligence Estimate before voting to authorize the president to go to war, Senator Obama had a clear shot. The woman who always does her homework did not bother to do her homework on the most important vote of her Senate career because her political viability was more important than the president's duplicity: She felt that, as a woman, she could not cast a flower-child vote if she wanted to run for president. At this fateful moment, she was thinking more of herself than her country. As someone who has been known to tailor the truth to accommodate her ambition, she looked away while W. was doing the same.Mr. Obama let the opportunity for a sharp comment pass. He made an oblique one, without mentioning her name, noting that former Senator Bob Graham said that the N.I.E. was one of the reasons he voted against the war authorization.He missed another chance when Hillary said at the beginning of the debate that she believed ''we are safer than we were'' before 9/11, even though the Democrats won Congress with the opposite argument last fall, and even though the Iraq war has clearly made the world more dangerous than ever.The next day, after reflecting on the matter overnight, the Obama campaign sent out a rebuttal to Hillary's ridiculous claim, citing reports showing that radicalization in the Muslim world and terrorism are spreading rather than diminishing. The belated memo was blandly addressed to ''Interested Parties.'' But by then the only thing that was interesting was why it took Obambi so long.Meanwhile, Hillary's Web site blared the headline ''In Command'' linking to ''raves'' of her confident debate performance.The Boy Wonder cannot take over the country unless he can take on Wonder Woman.Op-Ed ColumnistBe honest. Who would you rather share a foxhole with: a gay soldier or Mitt Romney?A gay soldier, of course. In a dicey situation like that, you need someone steadfast who knows who he is and what he believes, even if he's not allowed to say it out loud.Hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue, as the gloriously gay Oscar Wilde said. And gays are the sacrifice that hypocritical Republican candidates offer to placate ''values'' voters -- even though some candidates are not so finicky about morals regarding their own affairs and divorces.They may coo over the photo of Dick Cheney, whose re-election campaign demonized gays, proudly smiling with his new grandson, the first baby of his lesbian daughter, Mary.But they'll hold the line, by jiminy, against gay Americans who are willing to die or be horribly disfigured in the cursed Bush/Cheney war in Iraq.Peter Pace, whose job as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff became a casualty of Iraq on Friday, asserted in March that homosexual acts ''are immoral.'' Yet in May, he wrote a letter to the judge in the Scooter Libby case, pleading for leniency for the Cheney aide. Scooter always looked for ''the right way to proceed -- both legally and morally,'' General Pace wrote of the man who lied to a grand jury about the outing of a spy, after he pumped up the fake case for the war that has claimed the lives of 3,500 young men and women serving under the general.At the G.O.P. debate in New Hampshire last week, the contenders were more homophobic than the mobsters on ''The Sopranos,'' unanimously supporting the inane ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Even Rudy Giuliani, who loves to cross-dress and who stayed with old friends, a gay couple, to avoid Gracie Mansion when his second marriage was disintegrating, had an antediluvian answer.Wolf Blitzer asked him about the Arabic linguists trained by the government who have been ousted from the military after being outed.Mr. Giuliani, who procured three deferments to avoid Vietnam, replied that, with the war in Iraq raging, ''This is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this.''If he's so concerned with disruptive issues, maybe he should start worrying about this one: Two straight guys who slithered out of going to Vietnam are devising a losing strategy in Iraq year after year. W. and Dick Cheney have fouled things up so badly that Robert Gates and Tony Snow are now pointing to South Korea -- where American troops have stayed for over half a century -- as a model.Mitt Romney agreed with Rudy on the issue. Instead of going to Vietnam, Mr. Romney spent two and a half years doing Mormon missionary work in France. Isn't that like doing Peace Corps work in Monte Carlo?At the memorial for Mark Bingham, the gay 6-foot-5 rugby player who was on Flight 93 on 9/11, John McCain said he might owe his life to the young man who helped fight the hijackers, bringing down the plane aiming to crash into the Capitol.But Senator McCain wants gay troops to stay closeted. The policy, he said, is ''working.'' But it's not. The Army in Iraq is like that exhausted nag Scarlett O'Hara whipped on to Tara. Yet Republicans surge on, even as they expel gays.In a Times Op-Ed piece Friday, Stephen Benjamin, a gay Arabic translator eager to go to Iraq, told how he was dismissed when the Navy learned his status. ''Consider,'' he wrote. ''More than 58 Arabic linguists have been kicked out since 'don't ask, don't tell' was instituted. How much valuable intelligence could those men and women be providing today to troops in harm's way?''He noted that 11,000 other service members have been shoved out since 1993 and speculated that if the Army had not been so short of Arabic translators, the cables that went untranslated on Sept. 10, 2001, might have been translated, preventing 9/11.In 2000, the British military began letting anyone who served say if they were ''a poof,'' as one squadron leader put it. Sarah Lyall wrote in The Times that the military reports that none of its fears ''about harassment, discord, blackmail, bullying or an erosion of unit cohesion or military effectiveness have come to pass.''America has been Will-and-Graced since Bill Clinton had his kerfuffle on the issue in 1993. Tolerance has blossomed, especially among younger Americans. According to a Pew poll, 4-in-10 Americans say they have close friends or relatives who are gay.The Republican field seems stale and out of sync. They should have listened to the inimitable Barry Goldwater, who told it true: You don't have to be straight to shoot straight.Op-Ed ColumnistThey're both going out, not with a bang, but with a bing.As they go dark, the two Tonys are bitter, paranoid and worn down by their enemies and scheming erstwhile allies. They both live in a bleak universe of half-truths, compromises and betrayals, a world changed utterly by the violence they set in motion. They were both brought low by high-stakes mistakes.Tony Blair fears the feral beast. Tony Soprano is the feral beast.The two Tonys found that their skin was never thick enough. And they stumbled into trouble with their Juniors, Junior Bush and Junior Soprano. Before he steps down in two weeks, Tony Blair decided to let loose with one of those self-pitying Tony Soprano-style rants that drove Dr. Melfi to terminate him. Call it No. 10 Downer Street.''The fear of missing out means today's media, more than ever before, hunts in a pack,'' Mr. Blair said in a speech at Reuters in London. ''In these modes it is like a feral beast, just tearing people and reputations to bits. But no one dares miss out.''The British Tony actually begins his speech -- ''Reflections on the Future of Democracy and the Media, or Why Don't You Love Me?'' -- with the word ''whacking,'' as in: ''This is not my response to the latest whacking from bits of the media.''Of course it is, at least partly. Talk about hoist on your own press. When Tony Blair announced last month that he would step down, the press that once doted on him devoured him. The commentary was a frenzy of complaints about the slick Blair spin machine that had manipulated the media and turned British discourse to ''rot.''The movie, ''The Queen,'' recounted the young prime minister's triumph when he helped spin Diana's posthumous image as ''The People's Princess'' and cajoled the hidebound royals into listening and responding to the feral press beast that was tearing the monarchy's reputation to bits.But when the beast (as Evelyn Waugh slyly called his British newspaper in ''Scoop'') turned on Mr. Blair over various scandals, most importantly his unholy alliance with W. on Iraq, he grew disillusioned, the lion tamer mauled by his own lion.''The final consequence of all of this is that it is rare today to find balance in the media,'' Mr. Blair said. ''Things, people, issues, stories, are all black and white. Life's usual gray is almost entirely absent. 'Some good, some bad'; 'some things going right, some going wrong': these are concepts alien to today's reporting.''I worry more about the press when it's reverent rather than irreverent, when it's a tame lapdog, as it was in the buildup to Iraq, than when it's a feral beast. And I worry about politicians like W. and Blair being black and white rather than gray, as they were in building their hysterical, phony case against Saddam. We would have been well-served back then if Mr. Blair had explained to the jejune Junior that there's some good, some bad, and some gray in the world, and that sometimes it's smarter to squeeze tyrants, rather than Shock-and-Awe them.On his first visit to Baghdad Monday, Gordon Brown vowed never to repeat his partner's mistake of politicizing intelligence to go to war. We'll have to wait to see if David Chase, the Garbo of goombahs now pursued by a feral beast of disappointed ''Sopranos'' fans, is feeling as paranoid and thin-skinned as the two Tonys, and as deeply surprised by the consequences of his actions.Mr. Chase, an apocalyptic tease, gave us a gimmicky and unsatisfying film-school-style blackout for an end to his mob saga, a stunt one notch above ''It was all a dream.'' It was the TV equivalent of one of those design-your-own-mug places.Even though I loved the first few years of ''The Sopranos,'' Mr. Chase always struck me as passive-aggressive. The more fans obsessed on his show, the longer his hiatuses would grow and the slower his narrative velocity moved. His ending was equally perverse, throwing the ball contemptuously back at his fans after manipulating them and teasing them for an hour with red herrings -- and a ginger cat.After references in three shows to Yeats's ''The Second Coming'' -- the last allusion to the rough beast slouching toward Bethlehem by A.J. at the diner table in the final scene -- the least Mr. Chase could have dished up was some ''mere anarchy.''Surely, after eight years with this family, we deserved some revelation better than ''Life goes on.  Or not.''The only revelation was that Mr. Chase and James Gandolfini are keeping their options open for a Sopranos movie. Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic and a Sopranos aficionado who liked the might-or-might-not ending, tells me I made too much of the foreshadowing of the Yeats poem.''It's overused to express unhappiness,'' he said. ''If you're at a restaurant and you want linguine and they only have manicotti, we're slouching toward Bethlehem.''Op-Ed ColumnistThe busty brunette wriggles around in her pink bikini beside a picture of Barack Obama frolicking in the Hawaiian surf. She continues undulating in red underwear emblazoned with the word ''Obama.'' And, next to a picture of the senator in a suit, she stands proudly, wearing her own dark suit and a political-helpmate smile.''Does Barack Obama's wife have something to worry about?'' John Gibson teased on Fox News.Michelle doesn't have to worry about ''Obama Girl,'' the model Amber Lee Ettinger, who stars in the music video sweeping the Web, in which she lip-syncs a song called ''I Got a Crush on Obama.'' The sultry-catchy lyrics include ''You're into border security/let's break this border between you and me/universal health care reform/it makes me warm.''But Obama may have to worry about Obama Girl. For one thing, Amber -- whose résumé boasts that she was a ''featured cage dancer'' in the movie ''Uptown Girls'' -- isn't even sure she's going to vote for her video dreamboy. ''We'll see,'' she told ABC's Jake Tapper. ''Maybe.''And for another, Obama has been trying to beef up his image for months -- including writing a platitudinous manifesto in the new Foreign Affairs -- but the buzz is still about his beefcake side. The Democrat who's so afraid of looking like a pretty boy is once more drawing attention for his more superficial charms.When I stopped in a Ralph Lauren shop the other day, the sales staff had just sent off some clothes for an Obama photo shoot for a GQ cover.At his first news conference after he announced last February, Obama chastised reporters for writing about how good he looked in a swimsuit, and he defended hiring oppo-researchers, saying that it was ''essential to democracy'' to compare and contrast the candidates on the issues.So why would his aides send two sneering memos about the Clintons' finances to reporters this week, on a not-for-attribution condition?That's not sleazy so much as stupid.First of all, they didn't need to do anything. Other Democratic campaigns were already pelting reporters with e-mail pointing out the possible juicy conflicts in the Clinton filings.If the Obama Boys were determined to whack the Clintons on greed, they should have done so openly. Their clumsy attempt at cloak-and-dagger was bound to fail.A reporter gave their ''classified'' memos to the Clinton camp, and the Clinton camp gleefully spread them around to other reporters.The Obama Boys' inept leaking was compounded by over-the-top writing. They angered Indian-Americans, who accused them of stereotyping, and the campaign had to apologize. Under a flippant headline referring to ''Hillary Clinton (D-Punjab),'' one memo reported that Bill Clinton collected $300,000 for two speeches from Cisco in 2006 and Hillary accepted almost $60,000 in contributions from Cisco employees, even though the company was outsourcing jobs to India.The critique also stressed how rich Bill Clinton has grown from his friendship with the California supermarket mogul Ron Burkle. Ron lets his pal Bill fly on his plane and brought him into his Yucaipa fund, which, the Obama memo tut-tuts, has investments in astrological software and the distribution of Playboy.One question I'd like to ask the Leo who would be First Lad: When you rake in $10 million a year from speeches, do you really need that $150,000 for speaking to the Boys and Girls Club of L.A.?Hillaryland was panting for an opportunity to paint Obama as a hypocrite for saying he was different and above it all, while acting the same. And its best ally in undermining Obama is Obama, who hoists his pedestal so high he's bound to fall off. He seems more intent on proving he's pure than proving he's tough.The Clintons act high-minded and do-gooding, while employing a staff of hit men. Obama is tangled in contradictions of high and low, saint and killer, while Hillary moves like a shark.''She'd lean over and bite his ear off if that's what it takes,'' says Charlie Cook, the political analyst. ''The question is, will he do what it takes to win? This is a guy who did not have to deal with a single negative ad being run against him in the primary and general campaigns for the Senate. It was almost an immaculate conception.''Obama is too busy modeling to make this point, but the Clinton financial disclosures raise a big question: Do we want the country run again by a couple who get so easily wrapped around the fingers of anyone who is rich? As long as a guy was willing to give them millions, would it matter if his name were Al Capone?Op-Ed Columnist
