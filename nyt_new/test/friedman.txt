Last Saturday was a strange day. It started with the hanging of Saddam Hussein. The more I read about the hasty, quasi-legal maneuvers used by Iraq's Shiite leaders to rush Saddam to the gallows on a Muslim holiday, Id al-Adha, and the more I watched the grainy cellphone video of the event, in which a guard is heard taunting Saddam with chants of ''Moktada! Moktada!'' -- the Shiite cleric whose death squads have killed hundreds of Sunnis -- and the more I read of the insults Saddam spat back, the more it resembled a tribal revenge ritual rather than the culmination of a constitutional process in which America should be proud to have participated.Bassam al-Husseini, an aide to Iraq's Shiite prime minister, was quoted by the BBC as saying Saddam's execution was ''an Id gift to the Iraqi people.'' Many Sunnis would not share that view. For his part, Saddam, a Sunni, used his last breaths to spew vitriol against ''the traitors, the Americans, the spies and the Persians.'' For Persians, read Shiites.No wonder the BBC's world affairs editor, John Simpson, reported from Baghdad: ''Altogether, the execution as we now see it is shown to be an ugly, degrading business, which is more reminiscent of a public hanging in the 18th century than a considered act of 21st-century official justice. Under Saddam Hussein, prisoners were regularly taunted and mistreated in their last hours. The most disturbing thing about the new video of Saddam's execution for crimes precisely like this is that it is all much too reminiscent of what used to happen here.''But as I said, Saturday was a strange day. After watching Saddam's hanging in the morning, I was sitting at my computer late in the afternoon and suddenly heard the strains of ''My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty'' being played on the TV in the next room. When I checked what was going on, I saw President Ford's coffin being unloaded from Air Force One.I have to admit I got a lump in my throat watching that scene and listening to that stirring melody. Saddam's execution was a snapshot of a country divided. Gerald Ford's funeral was a snapshot of a country united -- political supporters and opponents alike paying tribute to a president, who was surrounded by an honor guard representing every color of the American rainbow and whose place in history was secured by an act of pardon and national healing.How fortunate to live in a country where this is the political norm, built up over generations.''Because of our basic unity, we can afford to be divided on specific issues,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, author of ''The Case for Goliath.'' ''Democracy is about differences and contesting them in the public sphere, and it only works when there is basic agreement about the fundamentals. We should feel fortunate that we have a democratic history and set of beliefs. Those beliefs can be imported by those who want them and don't have them, but they can't be exported. We can only create a context where others would want to import them.''The raw tribal theatrics of Saddam's hanging highlight just how few of these values Iraq has imported. We are to blame for not creating the security needed for those values to take hold. But not enough of our Iraqi allies have risen to the occasion, either. It was our closest Iraqi partners who oversaw Saddam's tribal hanging. We have to look that in the eye.Saddam deserved to die 100 deaths. But imagine if Iraq's Shiite leaders had surprised everyone, declared that there had been enough killing in Iraq and commuted Saddam's sentence to life in prison -- sparing his life in hopes of uniting the country rather than executing him and dividing it further. I don't know if it would have helped, but I do know Iraqis have rarely surprised us with gestures of reconciliation -- only with new ways to kill each other.Now President Bush wants a ''surge'' of more U.S. troops to Baghdad, in one last attempt to bring order. Whenever I hear this surge idea, I think of a couple who recently got married but the marriage was never very solid. Then one day they say to each other, ''Hey, let's have a baby, that will bring us together.'' It never works.If the underlying union is not there, adding a baby won't help. And if the underlying willingness to share power and resources is not present among the major communities in Iraq, adding more U.S. troops won't help either. Adding more troops makes sense only if it's to buy more time for positive trends that have already begun to appear on the horizon. I don't see them.As Saddam's hanging underscored, Iraqis are doing things their way. So maybe it's time to get out of their way.Op-Ed ColumnistNow that President Gerald Ford has been buried with all the honors he deserved, it is time to discuss a proper memorial. I would suggest the Gerald Ford Energy Independence Act.Few people remember today, but ''Gerald Ford was the first U.S. president to really use the levers of the presidency to try to break our addiction to oil,'' said the energy economist Philip Verleger Jr. ''He was way ahead of his time.''Well, his time has come again -- and then some.The greatest thing George Bush could do -- for President Ford's legacy and his own -- would be to dedicate his upcoming State of the Union address to completing the energy independence agenda that Mr. Ford initiated 32 years ago in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo and energy shock.As the page titled ''Energy'' from the Ford presidential library Web site reminds us: ''Early in his administration, President Ford said that he would not sit by and watch the nation continue to talk about an energy crisis and do nothing about it. Nor, he said, would he accept halfway measures which failed to change the direction that has made our nation so vulnerable to foreign economic interests. The president proposed firm but necessary measures designed to achieve energy independence for the U.S. by 1985, and to regain our position of world leadership in energy.''In his 1975 State of the Union speech, President Ford laid out his vision: ''I have a very deep belief in America's capabilities. Within the next 10 years, my program envisions: 200 major nuclear power plants; 250 major new coal mines; 150 major coal-fired power plants; 30 major new [oil] refineries; 20 major new synthetic fuel plants; the drilling of many thousands of new oil wells; the insulation of 18 million homes; and the manufacturing and the sale of millions of new automobiles, trucks and buses that use much less fuel.  In another crisis -- the one in 1942 -- President Franklin D. Roosevelt said this country would build 60,000 military aircraft. By 1943, production in that program had reached 125,000 aircraft annually. They did it then. We can do it now.''Obviously, President Ford's emphasis on coal and domestic oil came in age when most people were unaware of climate change. Still, Mr. Ford wasn't just all talk on energy. He used his presidential powers to impose a $3-a-barrel fee on imported oil to reduce consumption. That was a big deal, noted Mr. Verleger, because the average cost of imported crude at the time was only $10.76 a barrel.Yes, you read that right. A Republican president actually imposed an import fee on oil to curb consumption! Yes, President Bush, it can be done! The republic survived!Thanks to the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975 and other measures, Mr. Ford's energy legacy includes: the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for use in an emergency; the phasing out of domestic price controls on oil to encourage more exploration; major investment in alternative energy research; assistance to states in developing energy conservation programs; and, most important, the creation of the first compulsory mileage standards for U.S. automobiles.Those mileage standards have barely been tightened since 1975 -- because some idiotic congressmen from Michigan, who thought they were protecting Detroit, have blocked efforts to raise them. So, Japanese automakers innovated more in that area, and the rest is history -- or in the case of Detroit, obituary.Every 10 years we say to ourselves, ''If only we had done the right thing 10 years ago.'' Well, President Bush has a chance in his State of the Union to call on Americans to honor Mr. Ford by completing his vision. But it means asking Americans to do some hard things: accepting a gasoline or carbon tax; inducing Detroit to make more fuel-efficient cars, trucks and plug-in hybrids; setting a national requirement for utilities to provide 20 percent of their electricity from renewable wind, solar, hydro or nuclear power by 2015; and, finally, making large-scale investments in mass transit.It is stunning that since 9/11 the Bush team has never mounted a campaign to get Americans to conserve energy.''Ford called for zero oil imports by 1985,'' said Mr. Verleger. ''Instead, we imported five million barrels a day then. In 2006, imports will average almost 14 million barrels a day. Had we achieved everything Ford proposed, the price of oil today would be $20 a barrel, not $60, the polar ice caps might not be melting, the polar bear might still have a chance, and our children would have a future.''Op-Ed ColumnistAll environmentalists have their favorite ''green'' energy source that they think will break our addiction to oil and slow down climate change. I've come out to Montana to see mine. It's called coal.Yes, yes, I know, you thought I was going to say corn ethanol or switch grass or soybean diesel. Well, one day they all might reach a scale that can get us off oil. But the cheap, available fuel that China, India and America all have in abundance today -- and are all going to burn for the next decade -- is coal. So unless we can burn coal in a cleaner way, you can kiss the climate goodbye -- we'll all be wearing bikinis and shorts in Manhattan in January.When it comes to what it will take to ''green'' coal, there's no more informed or intrepid tour guide than Montana's Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer. The governor, a bulldozer of a man, met me in Billings in his little prop plane, we flew into a winter gale that tossed us around like salad pieces, and then we set down on a makeshift runway in Colstrip, on the edge of a coal strip mine. On the way back, after flying through another howling storm that caused me to dig my nails so deeply into the armrests I left my fingerprints in the leather, I thanked the pilots profusely. The governor simply bellowed, ''I'm glad we had our best interns flying today!''When it comes to cleaning up coal, though, Governor Schweitzer is dead serious.''Here in Montana we make our living outside,'' said the governor, an agronomist who got his start building farms in Saudi Arabia, ''and when you do that, you know the climate is changing. We don't get as much snow in the high country as we used to  and the runoff starts sooner in the spring.  The river I've been fishing over the last 50 years is now warmer in July by five degrees than 50 years ago, and it is hard on our trout population.  So when Exxon Mobil hires someone who calls himself a 'scientist' to claim this is not true, you don't have to get The New York Times to know the guy is blowing smoke.''But here's what the governor also knows: Montana has one-third of all the coal deposits in America -- 8 percent of all the coal in the world. Montana's coal is roughly equivalent to 240 billion barrels of oil. ''That's enough to replace all our imported oil for 60 years,'' he noted.That's the good news. The bad news is that because of global warming -- fueled in part by carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning electricity plants -- the only way we'll be able to use all those coal reserves is if we can burn coal without emitting the CO2. Otherwise we're cooked, literally.So Governor Schweitzer's crusade is to get the coal-burning industries to take the lead on this, in partnership with government. The governor recalled a recent conference of coal-dependent industries, held in Phoenix, at which he held up a lump of coal and warned: ''You are the people who represent the companies who will decide whether I'm holding up the future of energy or the past. Take a look at all the other people sitting at your table. You know who you see? You see the last remaining people on the planet who don't believe CO2 is a problem.  The only way you will make this the energy of the future is to recognize C02 as a problem and that you have to be part of the solution.'' And by the way, he added, ''there is a lot of money in it for you guys. You can sell this technology all over the world.''Governor Schweitzer has a plan for Washington: 1) Set a floor price for crude oil in the U.S. at $40 a barrel forever. That will tell Wall Street that if it invests in new, clean coal technologies -- which can be run profitably at the equivalent of $40 a barrel -- OPEC will never undercut them. 2) Set up a European-style cap and trade system rewarding companies that buy clean coal technologies and punishing those that don't. 3) Have Washington co-invest in a dozen pilot gasification and liquefaction technologies -- which already exist -- for cleaning coal and sequestering the carbon dioxide. Then we'll identify the best technologies quicker and move down the innovation curve. 4) Write the regulations now for how we will manage carbon dioxide that is removed from coal and stored underground.As we talked, four smokestacks from the coal-fired electricity plant in Colstrip, which helps power Portland and Seattle, were belching CO2.''For the last 100 years we built plants like this one,'' the governor said. ''It takes crushed coal, ignites it to heat water that produces steam, and that turns a turbine and produces electricity.  You build that smoke stack real high so that nasty stuff goes to someone else's backyard. Well, we've run out of backyards.''Op-Ed ColumnistI've heard the president's surge speech, and I have a reaction, an observation and some advice.My reaction to the president's speech was to recall a line from Bill Maher's book about the war against terrorists: ''Make them fight all of us.''Mr. President, you want a surge? I'll surge. I'll surge on the condition that you once and for all enlist the entire American people in this war effort, and stop putting it all on the shoulders of 130,000 military families, and now 20,000 more. I'll surge on the condition that you make them fight all of us -- and that means a real energy policy, with a real gasoline tax, that ends our addiction to oil, shrinks the flow of petro-dollars to bad actors and makes America the world's leader in conservation.But please, Mr. President, stop insulting our intelligence by telling us that this is the ''decisive ideological struggle of our time,'' but we're going to put the whole burden of victory on 150,000 U.S. soldiers. Yes, you're right, confronting violent Islamic radicalism by trying to tilt Iraq and the Arab-Muslim world onto a more progressive track is indeed hugely important. But the way you have fought this war -- with our pinky -- is contemptible. For three years you would not summon the military means to back your lofty ends.That led to a vacuum. The Sunnis, who refused to accept majority rule by Shiites, went on a murderous rampage, and that rampage has now metastasized into five different wars in Iraq: Sunnis against Shiites; Sunnis and Shiites against the U.S. ''occupiers''; Al Qaeda against the U.S.; Shiite theocratic thugs against ordinary Shiites; and Iran, Syria and all the Arab autocrats against any kind of democratic, Shiite-led Iraq that could be a model for their own people.Hence my observation: The notion that the only war in Iraq now is good guys versus terrorists is ludicrous. There is no center in Iraq. And when there is no center and you put in more troops, you end up supporting a side. (See Lebanon: 1982)And now for the advice. At this 11th hour, with Iraq's sectarian fires raging, the only way more U.S. troops might bring stability is if you add two missing elements: a deadline and a floor.You need to tell Iraqis that by calling for a surge in troops you're giving them one last chance to reconcile, otherwise we're gone by Dec. 1. And you need to tell Americans that you're creating a $45-a-barrel floor price for imported oil, so investors can safely finance alternatives without worrying that they'll be undercut by OPEC.By not setting a hard date to leave Iraq, we are only putting a floor under bad behavior and allowing Iraqi leaders to pay wholesale, not retail, for their tribal politics. If Sunnis or Shiites want it ''all'' in Iraq, they have to pay for it all.Of course, just leaving would be bad for us and terrible for those Iraqis who have worked with us. We need to give them all U.S. passports. We have a moral responsibility to them. But it would also be bad for a lot of bad people. They would be left to fight it out with each other. And yes, Syria and Iran would ''win'' Iraq -- meaning they'd win the responsibility of managing the mess there or have it spill over on them. Have a nice day.And by not setting a hard floor price for oil to promote alternative energy, we are only helping to subsidize bad governance by Arab leaders toward their people and bad behavior by Americans toward the climate.Make them fight all of us, Mr. President, or don't do it at all! If we made ourselves energy independent, we would bring down global oil prices, which would not only shrink the resources for mischief by our enemies and limit Saudi Arabia's ability to transform Islam all over the world into its most intolerant Wahhabi form, but also, more important, would force the Arab world to reform. It would force Arab leaders, including Iraqis, to organize their societies in ways that would tap their people, not just their oil wells -- whether our troops were there or not. Also, if the rest of the world saw all of us sacrificing to win this war, we might actually be able to enlist them to help a little.More troops alone will not suffice. The only tiny hope left of transforming Iraq is if its leaders have to pay the full retail price of their passions and we have to pay the full retail price of our oil. And if even that won't work, then setting a date and setting an oil price will extract us from this disaster and make us less vulnerable to the madness we leave behind.If we fail in Iraq, at least let America be stronger -- by being energy independent -- the morning after.Op-Ed ColumnistWell, so much for our daffodils! They all bloomed in our front yard last week. They now form a nice bright yellow cluster at the bottom of our driveway. Temperatures of 65 degrees in Washington in January will do that. Frankly, daffodils in January do brighten up the lawn. Maybe next year we'll try for roses in February.Don't know about you, but when I see things in nature that I've never seen in my life, like daffodils blooming in January, it starts to feel creepy, like a ''Twilight Zone'' segment. I half expect to wake one day and find Rod Serling mowing my lawn -- in shorts.Why not? Last December was the fourth warmest on record, and 2006 was the hottest year in America since 1895. It was declared the hottest in Britain since 1659.Even the White House seems to have noticed. Al Hubbard, the president's economic adviser, says Mr. Bush will soon unveil an energy independence strategy that will produce ''headlines above the fold that will knock your socks off.'' Since everything the president has done on energy up to now has left my socks firmly in place, I will be eager to hear what Mr. Bush says.Neither the White House nor the Democratic Party seems to grasp that the public and business community are miles ahead of them on this energy/environment issue. The presidential candidate who finally figures that out, though -- and comes up with a compelling energy/environment agenda -- is going to have a real leg up in 2008.What would be compelling? I used to think it would be a ''Manhattan Project'' on energy. I don't any longer. I've learned that there is no magic bullet for reducing our dependence on oil and emissions of greenhouse gases -- and politicians who call for one are usually just trying to avoid asking for sacrifice today.The right rallying call is for a ''Green New Deal.'' The New Deal was not built on a magic bullet, but on a broad range of programs and industrial projects to revitalize America. Ditto for an energy New Deal. If we are to turn the tide on climate change and end our oil addiction, we need more of everything: solar, wind, hydro, ethanol, biodiesel, clean coal and nuclear power -- and conservation.It takes a Green New Deal because to nurture all of these technologies to a point that they really scale would be a huge industrial project. If you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof, bless your heart. But we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid -- moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables. And that is a huge industrial project -- much bigger than anyone has told you. Finally, like the New Deal, if we undertake the green version, it has the potential to create a whole new clean power industry to spur our economy into the 21st century.To spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances -- and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power -- California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per-capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants.Had Ronald Reagan not rolled back the higher fuel efficiency standards imposed on Detroit, we might need no Middle East oil today. High standards force innovation, and innovation leads to conservation at scale.But prices also matter. I don't care whether it is a federal gasoline tax, carbon tax, B.T.U. tax or cap-and-trade system, power utilities, factories and car owners have to be required to pay the real and full cost to society of the carbon they put into the atmosphere. And higher costs for fossil fuels make more costly clean alternatives more competitive.''The regulated utilities are the most important consumers from the perspective of long-term investment, and if they are not required to value carbon reduction then they will under-invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy,'' Peter Darbee, chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric, said to me.This isn't rocket science. Government standards matter. They drive innovation and efficiency. And prices matter. They drive more and cleaner energy choices. So when the president unveils his energy proposals, if they don't call for higher efficiency standards and higher prices for fossil fuels -- take your socks off yourself. It's going to get hot around here.Op-Ed ColumnistIt's hard to know what's more disturbing: the barbaric sectarian murders by Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, or the deafening silence with which these mass murders are received in the Muslim world. How could it be that Danish cartoons of Muhammad led to mass violent protests, while unspeakable violence by Muslims against Muslims in Iraq every day evokes about as much reaction in the Arab-Muslim world as the weather report? Where is the Muslim Martin Luther King? Where is the ''Million Muslim March'' under the banner: ''No Shiites, No Sunnis: We are all children of the Prophet Muhammad.''I can logically understand the lack of protest when Muslims kill Americans in Iraq. We're seen as occupiers by many. But I can't understand how the mass slaughter of 70 Baghdad college students last week by Sunni suicide bombers or the blowing up of a Shiite mosque on the first day of Ramadan in 2005 evoke so little response. Every day it's 100 more.I raise this question because the only hope left for Iraq -- if there is any -- is not in a U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. That may be necessary, but without a Muslim counternihilism strategy that delegitimizes the mass murder of Muslims by Muslims, there is no hope for decent politics there. It takes a village, and right now the Muslim village is mute. It has no moral voice when it comes to its own.''The Koran describes the Prophet Muhammad as a Prophet of Mercy,'' said Husain Haqqani, the Pakistani-born director of Boston University's Center for International Relations. ''Muslims begin all their acts, including worship, with the words: 'In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.' The Koran also says, 'To you, your faith, and to me, mine.' But unfortunately, these mercy-focused, peacemaking ideas are lost [today] in the overall discourse in the Muslim world about reviving lost glory and setting right the injustice of Western domination.''For a Muslim Martin Luther King to emerge, Muslim discourse would have to shift away from the focus on power and glory and include taking responsibility as a community for our own situation.''In fairness, for a Martin Luther King to emerge requires some free space, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, the courageous Egyptian democracy campaigner, remarked to me. But right now many liberals in the Arab world are in one way or another under house arrest by their regimes. ''While Islamists in Egypt have access to thousands of mosques and can meet with their followers five times a day,'' Mr. Ibrahim said, liberal members of his own institute ''can barely move in Cairo, let alone organize a march.''The Arab regimes want America to believe that there are only two choices: Islamists and the regimes, so it will side with the regimes.This is one reason Mr. Ibrahim hopes the Islamists will take up the democratic agenda. They could carry it to the masses. One of the most popular Islamist leaders in the Arab world today, he notes, is Hezbollah's Sheik Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. Up to now, though, the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas seem to prefer being of pawns of Syria and Iran than agents of democratic change and Muslim reconciliation.There's a lot at stake. If Iraq is ultimately unraveled by Muslim suicide-nihilism, it certainly will be a blot on our history -- we opened this Pandora's box. But it will be a plague on the future of the whole Arab world.If Arab Muslims can summon the will to protest only against the insults of ''the foreigner'' but never the injuries inflicted by their own on their own, how can they ever generate a modern society or democracy -- which is all about respecting and protecting minority voices and unorthodox views? And if Sunnis and Shiites can never form a social contract to rule themselves -- and will always require an iron-fisted dictator -- decent government will forever elude them.The brutally honest Syrian-born poet Ali Ahmad Said, known as Adonis, gave an interview from Paris on March 11, 2006, with Dubai TV, and warned of what's at stake (translation by Memri):''The Arab individual is no less smart, no less a genius, than anyone else in the world. He can excel -- but only outside his society.  If I look at the Arabs, with all their resources and great capacities, and I compare what they have achieved over the past century with what others have achieved in that period, I would have to say that we Arabs are in a phase of extinction, in the sense that we have no creative presence in the world.''We have the quantity. We have the masses of people, but a people becomes extinct when it no longer has a creative capacity, and the capacity to change its world.''Op-Ed ColumnistSorry to repeat myself, but I have the same reaction to this year's energy proposals in the State of the Union that I had to last year's. President Bush had the opportunity to launch America on a transformative new path for clean, efficient power. He had a chance for a ''Nixon to China'' moment -- as the Texas oilman who leads us into a greener future. Instead, he gave us ''Nixon to New Mexico'' -- right direction, but not nearly far enough.As I read the president's remarks, listened to the tepid public reaction and looked at his latest polls, which show Mr. Bush to be wildly unpopular, it seemed to me that the American people basically fired George Bush in the last election. We're now just watching him clean out his desk. Both his energy proposals and his recent Iraq surge were about the best he could muster, given his pink slip.The problem is that he is going to be cleaning out his desk for another two years, and Americans deserve better. I would love to see Democrats put that something better on Mr. Bush's desk -- regarding both energy and Iraq.''The stakes on Iraq and on climate change are way too large for us all to be just couch potatoes waiting for the messiah to come in 2009,'' said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense. ''That is not an option. Yes, it would be entertaining, but we need leadership on these issues, and we need it now.''On energy -- no, the president's proposals were not just beanbag. His call to reform CAFE mileage standards for U.S. cars ''shifts the debate from whether to compel U.S. automakers to build more fuel-efficient vehicles to how much they should do so,'' notes a strategy consultant, Peter Schwartz. And his call for a nearly fivefold mandatory increase in the production of ethanol and other alternative fuels for cars and trucks also changes the debate from whether to how much, and which fuels.But the devil will be in the details. Will liquefied coal be one of those alternatives -- which could add to global warming -- or only non-fossil-fuel alternatives? On mileage standards, U.S. automakers will lobby the White House very hard for the smallest possible change. Will they get their way? If so, there isn't much here.The really bold, transformative -- and popular -- initiative Mr. Bush should have offered would either be a national cap-and-trade system for controlling CO2 emissions by utilities, manufacturers and autos, or a carbon tax. Both would create economic incentives for us to get rid of appliances, buildings and cars that emit a lot of CO2 and to invent and purchase those that don't.But there is no reason that the Democrats could not right now put a cap-and-trade bill on Mr. Bush's desk themselves by spring, Mr. Krupp said, ''and I think Bush would sign it.''It is not enough for Democrats to just hold hearings on climate change. They need to use their new power to change the climate. Not only would the public be with them, but so would big business. A coalition of America's best companies -- like General Electric, DuPont, Duke Energy, Alcoa, Caterpillar -- and environmentalists just issued a ''call to action'' for a national cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions.On Iraq: talking to some of our senior military lately, I've been struck by how concerned they are about the new Bush buildup against Iran. Before we have even won one war in Iraq, the Bush team seems to be courting another with Iran. I am all for brandishing the stick with Iran, but it should be for the purpose of gaining leverage for a diplomatic dialogue with Iran and Syria about Iraq.''When your house is burning, you don't go looking to start a fire in the next house,'' said Vali Nasr, author of the ''The Shia Revival.'' Right now, he adds, everything should be subordinated to trying to salvage Iraq.Let the troop surge be accompanied and reinforced by what the Baker-Hamilton commission proposed: a regional conference that puts Syria, Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia around a table with Iraqis to try to stabilize the place. And that requires that America brandish carrots and sticks with all the parties. If a real regional conference doesn't work, then Democrats who want to just set a date to withdraw will have an even stronger case because we will truly have tried everything. But let's try everything: a surge of diplomacy, not just troops.Let the Democrats put that on the president's desk. Just as the business community would support a real climate initiative, I think the U.S. military would support a real diplomatic conference. Bush gave America's voters the reasons to fire him. Democrats need to give voters the reasons to hire them -- for the long haul.Op-Ed ColumnistHere's a little foreign policy test. I am going to describe two countries -- ''Country A'' and ''Country B'' -- and you tell me which one is America's ally and which one is not.Let's start: Country A actively helped the U.S. defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan and replace it with a pro-U.S. elected alliance of moderate Muslims. Country A regularly holds sort-of-free elections. Country A's women vote, hold office, are the majority of its university students and are fully integrated into the work force.On 9/11, residents of Country A were among the very few in the Muslim world to hold spontaneous pro-U.S. demonstrations. Country A's radical president recently held a conference about why the Holocaust never happened -- to try to gain popularity. A month later, Country A held nationwide elections for local councils, and that same president saw his candidates get wiped out by voters who preferred more moderate conservatives. Country A has a strategic interest in the success of the pro-U.S., Shiite-led, elected Iraqi government. Although it's a Muslim country right next to Iraq, Country A has never sent any suicide bombers to Iraq, and has long protected its Christians and Jews. Country A has more bloggers per capita than any country in the Muslim Middle East.The brand of Islam practiced by Country A respects women, is open to reinterpretation in light of modernity and rejects Al Qaeda's nihilism.Now Country B: Country B gave us 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11. Country B does not allow its women to drive, vote or run for office. It is illegal in Country B to build a church, synagogue or Hindu temple. Country B helped finance the Taliban.Country B's private charities help sustain Al Qaeda. Young men from Country B's mosques have been regularly recruited to carry out suicide bombings in Iraq. Mosques and charities in Country B raise funds to support the insurgency in Iraq. Country B does not want the elected, Shiite-led government in Iraq to succeed. While Country B's leaders are pro-U.S., polls show many of its people are hostile to America -- some of them celebrated on 9/11. The brand of Islam supported by Country B and exported by it to mosques around the world is the most hostile to modernity and other faiths.Question: Which country is America's natural ally: A or B?Country A is, of course. Country A is Iran. Country B is Saudi Arabia.Don't worry. I know that Iran has also engaged in terrorism against the U.S. and that the Saudis have supported America at key times in some areas. The point I'm trying to make, though, is that the hostility between Iran and the U.S. since the overthrow of the shah in 1979 is not organic. By dint of culture, history and geography, we actually have a lot of interests in common with Iran's people. And I am not the only one to notice that.Because the U.S. has destroyed Iran's two biggest enemies -- the Taliban and Saddam -- ''there is now a debate in Iran as to whether we should continue to act so harshly against the Americans,'' Mohammad Hossein Adeli, Iran's former ambassador to London, told me at Davos. ''There is now more readiness for dialogue with the United States.''More important, when people say, ''The most important thing America could do today to stabilize the Middle East is solve the Israel-Palestine conflict,'' they are wrong. It's second. The most important thing would be to resolve the Iran-U.S. conflict.That would change the whole Middle East and open up the way to solving the Israel-Palestine conflict, because Iran is the key backer of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and Syria. Iran's active help could also be critical for stabilizing Iraq.This is why I oppose war with Iran. I favor negotiations. Isolating Iran like Castro's Cuba has produced only the same result as in Cuba: strengthening Iran's Castros. But for talks with Iran to bear fruit, we have to negotiate with Iran with leverage.How do we get leverage? Make it clear that Iran can't push us out of the gulf militarily; bring down the price of oil, which is key to the cockiness of Iran's hard-line leadership; squeeze the hard-liners financially. But all this has to be accompanied with a clear declaration that the U.S. is not seeking regime change in Iran, but a change of behavior, that the U.S. wants to immediately restore its embassy in Tehran and that the first thing it will do is grant 50,000 student visas for young Iranians to study at U.S. universities.Just do that -- and then sit back and watch the most amazing debate explode inside Iran. You can bet the farm on it.Op-Ed ColumnistThere may be only one thing dumber than getting addicted to consuming oil as a country -- and that is getting addicted to selling it. Because getting addicted to selling oil can make your country really stupid, and if the price of oil suddenly drops, it can make your people really revolutionary. That's the real story of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union -- it overdosed on oil -- and it could end up being the real story of Iran, if we're smart.It is hard to come to Moscow and not notice what the last five years of high oil prices have done for middle-class consumption here. Five years ago, it took me 35 minutes to drive from the Kremlin to Moscow's airport. On Monday, it took me two and half hours. There was one long traffic jam from central Moscow to the airport, because a city built for 30,000 cars, which 10 years ago had 300,000 cars, today has three million cars and a ring of new suburbs.How Russia deals with its oil and gas windfall is going to be a huge issue. But today I'd like to focus on how the Soviet Union was killed, in part, by its addiction to oil, and on how we might get leverage with Iran, based on its own addiction.Economists have long studied this phenomenon, but I got focused on it here in Moscow after chatting with Vladimir Mau, the president of Russia's Academy of National Economy. I mentioned to him that surely the Soviet Union died because oil fell to $10 a barrel shortly after Mikhail Gorbachev took office, not because of anything Ronald Reagan did. Actually, Professor Mau said, it was ''high oil prices'' that killed the Soviet Union. The sharp rise in oil prices in the 1970s deluded the Kremlin into overextending subsidies at home and invading Afghanistan abroad -- and then the collapse in prices in the '80s helped bring down the overextended empire.Here's the story: The inefficient Soviet economy survived in its early decades, Professor Mau explained, thanks to cheap agriculture, from peasants forced into collective farms, and cheap prison labor, used to erect state industries. Beginning in the 1960s, however, even these cheap inputs weren't enough, and the Kremlin had to start importing, rather than exporting, grain. Things could have come unstuck then. But the 1973 Arab oil embargo and the sharp upsurge in oil prices -- Russia was the world's second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia -- gave the Soviet Union a 15-year lease on life from a third source of cheap resources: ''oil and gas,'' Professor Mau said.The oil windfall gave the Brezhnev government ''money to buy the support of different interest groups, like the agrarians, import some goods and buy off the military-industrial complex,'' Professor Mau said. ''The share of oil in total exports went from 10-to-15 percent to 40 percent.'' This made the Soviet Union only more sclerotic. ''The more oil you have, the less policy you need,'' he noted.In the 1970s, Russia exported oil and gas and ''used this money to import food, consumer goods and machines for extracting oil and gas,'' Professor Mau said. By the early 1980s, though, oil prices had started to sink -- thanks in part to conservation efforts by the U.S. ''One alternative for the Soviets was to decrease consumption, but the Kremlin couldn't do that -- it had been buying off all these constituencies,'' Professor Mau explained. So ''it started borrowing from abroad, using the money mostly for consumption and subsidies, to maintain popularity and stability.'' Oil prices and production kept falling as Mr. Gorbachev tried reforming communism, but by then it was too late.The parallel with Iran, Professor Mau said, is that the shah used Iran's oil windfall after 1973 to push major modernization onto a still traditional Iranian society. The social backlash produced the ayatollahs of 1979. The ayatollahs used Iran's oil windfall to lock themselves into power.In 2005, Bloomberg.com reported, Iran's government earned $44.6 billion from oil and spent $25 billion on subsidies -- for housing, jobs, food and 34-cents-a-gallon gasoline -- to buy off interest groups. Iran's current populist president has further increased the goods and services being subsidized.So if oil prices fall sharply again, Iran's regime will have to take away many benefits from many Iranians, as the Soviets had to do. For a regime already unpopular with many of its people, that could cause all kinds of problems and give rise to an Ayatollah Gorbachev. We know how that ends. ''Just look at the history of the Soviet Union,'' Professor Mau said.In short, the best tool we have for curbing Iran's influence is not containment or engagement, but getting the price of oil down in the long term with conservation and an alternative-energy strategy. Let's exploit Iran's oil addiction by ending ours.Op-Ed ColumnistListening, from Moscow, to the debate in Congress about Iraq is troubling: it sounds as if the American people are being offered two routes to a dead end: either follow President Bush and have troops surging into a roiling civil war, or go with one of the Congressional resolutions and denounce the surge, but without any alternative strategy for securing U.S. interests.I believe there is an alternative strategy, but it will take two concrete numbers to implement: a date -- Dec. 1 -- and a price -- $3.50 cents a gallon. Let me explain.What is the U.S. interest in Iraq right now? It's to quell the civil war enough so the parties may eventually reach a negotiated settlement, and if that proves impossible, to get America out of Iraq with the least damage to our interests.We will not quell this civil war with a surge of troops alone. The only thing that will do that is a power-sharing, oil-revenue-sharing deal between the parties. The only way we will get serious negotiations going is with leverage that America does not now have: leverage on the parties inside and outside Iraq. Negotiating in the Middle East without leverage is futile. These folks know how to calculate the balance of power down to the last ounce.So how do we get leverage? The first way to do that is by setting a firm date to leave -- Dec. 1. All U.S. military forces are either going to be home for Christmas 2007 or redeployed along the borders of Iraq, away from the civil war.Right now everyone in Iraq is having their cake and eating it -- at our expense. We have to change that.The Sunnis, who started this whole murderous cycle, participate in the government, negotiate with us and also indulge the suicide bombers and the insurgents. The Shiites collaborate with us, run their own retaliatory death squads and dabble with Iran. The Saudis tell us we can't leave, but their mosques and charities funnel Sunni suicide bombers to Iraq and dollars to insurgents. Iran pushes its Iraqi Shiite allies to grab more power, while helping others kill U.S. troops. Ditto Syria.O.K., boys, party's over: we're leaving by Dec. 1. From now on, everyone pays retail for their politics. We will no longer play host to a war where we're everyone's protector and target. If you Sunnis want to go on resisting, we'll leave you to the tender mercies of the Shiites, who vastly outnumber you. You Shiites, if you want to run Iraq without compromising with Sunnis, fine, but you'll have to fight them alone and then risk having to live under the thumb of Iran.You Saudis and other Arabs, if you don't use your influence to delegitimize Sunni suicide bombers and press Iraq's Sunnis to cut a deal, we won't protect you from the consequences. And Iran, you win -- yes, if we leave, you win the right to try to manage Iraq's Shiites. Have a nice day.But at the same time, we have to impose a tax that creates a floor price of $3.50 a gallon for gasoline -- forever. This is also about leverage. It says to all the parties: we are going to conserve enough gasoline and spur enough clean alternatives to fossil fuels that no matter what you all do in the Middle East, we will not depend on you for energy.Today in Iraq, none of the key parties have to make any choices, and we don't have any choices. That is the definition of ''stuck.'' Right now we can win only if all the parties in and around Iraq act in the most farsighted and flexible manner. Otherwise we lose in our attempt to democratize Iraq, and we're left holding the bag. We need to be in a win-win situation that we control.''I don't think at this stage that the promise of 20,000 more troops will change any minds in Iraq,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, author of ''The Case for Goliath.'' ''But the threat of a lot fewer U.S. troops might conceivably get everyone focused. Right now, the U.S. is the passenger in a car that other countries are driving -- and it's not going in the right direction. We have to change that dynamic.''Indeed we do. Once we've set a date to leave by and a gas price to live by, we, for the first time, will have choices in Iraq. We can stay to broker a deal if the parties want to be guided by their better angels or, if they want tribal instincts to reign, we can leave by Dec. 1 and insulate ourselves from Islam's civil war with a new energy policy.To put it another way, if setting a date to leave miraculously brings them to their senses, our aspirations for the Iraqis will have been achieved, and we'll be stronger. And if it doesn't, but we have set an exit date and a gas price, we'll be out of Iraq and more energy-secure -- and we'll also be stronger.Op-Ed ColumnistRussia today is a country that takes three hands to describe.On the one hand, it is impossible any more to call Vladimir Putin's government ''democratic,'' given the way it has neutered the Russian Parliament, intimidated or taken over much of the Russian press, subordinated the judiciary and coercively extended its control over the country's key energy companies.On the other hand, it is obvious talking to Russians how much the humiliating and dispiriting turmoil that accompanied Boris Yeltsin's first stab at democracy -- after the collapse of Communism -- left many people here starved for a strong leader, a stable economy and stores with Western consumer goods. Mr. Putin is popular for a reason.And on the third hand, while today's Russia may be a crazy quilt of capitalist czars, mobsters, nationalists and aspiring democrats, it is not the totalitarian Soviet Union. It has more than a touch of the authoritarianism of postwar Gaullist France and a large spoonful of the corruption and messiness of postwar Italy -- when those countries emerged from World War II as less than perfect democracies.But 60 years later, after huge growth in their per capita incomes, France and Italy now help to anchor Western Europe. For all of their shortcomings, their postwar governments provided the context for the true democratic agent of change to come of age -- something that takes 9 months and 21 years to produce -- a generation raised on basically free markets and free politics. I still think Russia will follow a similar path -- in time.''In historical terms, the transition will be very fast,'' Boris Makarenko, deputy chief of Russia's Center for Political Technologies, said to me. ''But I am 47. I am in a hurry. I am very optimistic [though] for my daughter, who is 15.  I can see the normal middle class rising here. It's all about shape and pace. When will we get there, I don't know -- we will get there, but probably not fast enough for me to see.''The Yeltsin democratic experiment is over, to be sure, added Rose Gottemoeller, director of the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow office, ''because it was delegitimized by the 1998 ruble crash and because it was a time of supreme corruption and dominance by oligarchs -- but the Russian democratic experiment is not over because Russia is such a changed place.''Ms. Gottemoeller, an American, told me she recently visited Ulyanovsk, Lenin's birthplace, in the heart of Russia's aging industrial rust belt, and went out to dinner with three Russian couples, all new entrepreneurs.''After they plied me with drinks,'' she recalled, ''they said: 'O.K., we have a question. We want to know how you define middle class' -- and did I think they were middle class? And that just flummoxed me.  They wanted to know what middle class was in America. It meant a lot to them to think they were linked up to a broader community of middle class.  [They] are not out in the streets with a banner, but their aspirations are huge and in the right direction.''People who identify themselves as middle class often end up fighting for legal and civil rights to protect their gains, without even knowing they are fighting for them. That said, the pace of democratization here will most likely depend on three things.One is whether this emerging middle class gets so preoccupied with material gains -- thanks to the trickle-down of high oil and gas prices -- that ''it just disconnects from politics,'' Ms. Gottemoeller noted. (Russia today has more cellphones than people!) Another is the genie of Russian nationalism, which can always pop up and derail democratization. Just down the street from my hotel, the Movement Against Illegal Immigration held a march denouncing Jews and immigrants.Third is the price of oil and gas. Anyone who observes Russia can see that the price of oil and the pace of freedom here operate with an inverse correlation. As oil prices go down the pace of freedom goes up, because Russia has to open itself more to the world and empower its people to get ahead. As oil prices go up the pace of freedom goes down, because the government can get by drilling oil wells, rather than unleashing its people.''When oil prices became higher, the reforms became slower,'' said Vladimir Ryzhkov, a liberal Russian Duma member from Altay. ''Russia became a more closed country with a more state-oriented economy. Last year we saw record oil prices and not one reform. [That is the] reason Freedom House last year proclaimed Russia a 'non-free country. '  The question for you Americans is: When will prices go down? It is the only hope for us Russian democrats.''Op-Ed ColumnistForeign policy experts are still trying to parse Vladimir Putin's weekend blast against America, which he described as a brutish country that ''has overstepped its national borders, in every area.'' But rather than asking what exactly motivated Mr. Putin to lash out at the U.S. in this way, the question we should be asking is: why do remarks like these play so well in Russia today?I've just returned from Moscow and I can tell you what analysts there told me, what even Russian liberals reminded me of: NATO expansion. We need to stop kidding ourselves. After the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, the Bush I and Clinton administrations decided to build a new security alliance -- an expanded NATO -- and told Russia it could not be a member.And let's not forget that the Russia we told to stay out in the cold was the Russia of Boris Yeltsin and his liberal reformist colleagues. They warned us at the time that this would undercut them. But the Clinton folks told us: ''Don't worry, Russia is weak; Yeltsin will swallow hard and accept NATO expansion. There will be no cost.''So, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were invited to join NATO in 1997, and Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia followed in 2002. Lately, there has been talk of Ukraine and Georgia also joining.I believe that one reason Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer and cold warrior, was able to come to power after Mr. Yeltsin was partly due to the negative vibes of NATO expansion. We told Russia: Swallow your pride, it's a new world. We get to have spheres of influence and you don't -- and ours will go right up to your front door.But now that high oil and gas prices have made Russia powerful again -- the gasman of Europe -- Mr. Putin is shoving Russia's resurgent pride right back in our face. In effect, he is saying to America: ''Oh, you talkin' to me? You thought you could tell me that the cold war was over and that NATO expansion was not directed at Russia -- but we couldn't be members anyway. Did you really think we were going to believe that? Well, now I'm talkin' to you. Get out of my face.''Mr. Putin was only slightly more diplomatic in his Munich remarks, where he said: ''The process of NATO expansion has nothing to do with modernization of the alliance. We have the right to ask, 'Against whom is this expansion directed?' '' We all know the answer: it's directed against Russia. O.K., fine, we were ready to enrage Russia to expand NATO, but what have we gotten out of it? The Czech Navy?For those of us who opposed NATO expansion, the point was simple: there is no major geopolitical issue, especially one like Iran, that we can resolve without Russia's help. So why not behave in a way that maximizes Russia's willingness to work with us and strengthens its democrats, rather than expanding NATO to countries that can't help us and are not threatened anymore by Russia, and whose democracies are better secured by joining the European Union?I got an earful on this from Russians. ''NATO expansion was not necessary,'' Vladimir Ryzhkov, one of the last liberal Duma members who is ready to openly criticize the Putin government, said to me. ''In the current world, Russia is not a military danger for any neighbor. It was the wrong concept. You need another architecture.''Aleksei Pushkov, who has a foreign policy news show on Russian TV, said: ''NATO expansion was a message to Russia that you are on your own. Russians were unhappy. We said: 'The cold war is over, so what is this? They are moving a military alliance toward Russia's border.'''At the time of NATO expansion, I was running around the world saying one thing: 'Don't do it, or, if you do, stop with the Baltic states because you are losing Russia,' '' Mr. Pushkov added. ''And the answer I got was fantastic: 'What can Russia do? What measures can you take?' I said, 'We can't take any measures. You are losing an ally.' Because there is a deep tectonic shift in the Russian psyche that says, 'These guys are about exploiting Russia's weakness. They don't want it as an ally, but as a junior partner that will be like a little dog doing whatever they say.' ''I'm not here to defend an iron-fisted autocrat like Mr. Putin. But history is prologue. The fact is, we helped to create a mood in Russia hospitable to a conservative cold warrior like Mr. Putin by forcing NATO on a liberal democrat like Mr. Yeltsin. It was a bad decision and one that keeps on giving. Just when we need to be getting Russia's help, we're getting its revenge.Op-Ed ColumnistIn a high-rise building with a view of Lenin's Tomb, the U.S. aerospace giant Boeing is designing key parts of its new 787 Dreamliner, using hundreds of Russian aerospace engineers. Yes, President Putin may be talking cold-war tough, but down the street from the Kremlin, America's crown jewel industrial company is using Russia's crown jewel brainpower to design its next crown jewel jetliner.Boeing's Moscow Design Center, which employs 1,400 Russian engineers (earning less than their U.S. counterparts) on various projects, symbolizes Russia's unique potential: Russia is that rare country that not only has a treasure trove of natural resources -- oil, gas and mines -- but also has a treasure trove of human talent: engineers, mathematicians and other valuable minds.Most nations with highly developed human talent -- like Singapore or Taiwan -- have few natural resources, and those that are rich in natural resources -- Venezuela or Sudan -- tend not to develop their people's talents. The exceptions, like Norway, which is rich in both human and natural resources, usually built their democratic institutions before they got rich on oil, so the money was well spent.The meta-question with Russia today is this: Will it become more like Norway, a democracy enriched by oil, or more like Venezuela, a democracy subverted by oil? Is the Boeing center Russia's future or its exception?You see signs of both trends. On the positive side, Russia has been smarter than most petro-states. It has set up a rainy day fund and tucked away $100 billion from its oil and gas windfall. Direct foreign investment in Russia hit $30 billion last year, according to The Economist, and not all of it goes to the oil and gas sector anymore.And then there's Boeing. Its impressive Moscow center operates two shifts of engineers: 7 a.m. until 3 p.m., and 3 p.m. until 11 p.m. -- which is during the workday in the United States. A Russian Boeing engineer might be designing part of the 787's nose during his day, and then initials and stores his work in the computer. A U.S. Boeing engineer, working on an identical computer, then picks it up during her day and engineers it some more. With regular teleconferences, it's as if they are in one virtual 24-hour office.''There is no paper at all,'' said Sergei Korolev, the deputy head of Boeing Moscow. ''We do the presentations electronically and have online sessions with Wichita and Seattle, and everyone looks at the same part and talks about it. Our center is the reason people are not emigrating.''But Russia has a unique legacy in aerospace from Soviet days, so the educational centers and talent were in place for Boeing to tap. What Russia still glaringly lacks is an ecosystem of secure property rights, venture capitalists and homegrown innovators, and universities and business schools churning out idea-entrepreneurs. ''Made in Russia'' will never be a global brand as long as research spending by Russian companies remains among the lowest in the world.The Moscow Times recently reported that only two Russian colleges -- Moscow State and St. Petersburg State -- are listed among the world's top 500 universities. When you walk down the streets in Bangalore, India's high-tech capital, it feels as if there's a computer school or English-language school on every street. You walk in Moscow, and it feels as if there is a new shoe store or beauty salon on every street.A former top aide to President Putin remarked to me that Russia had a huge interest in building a postindustrial knowledge economy, not an energy-intensive industrial one, so it can export most of its oil and gas, not consume them at home. But that would take a big investment in education, which is not being done.Noting that Russia today spends far less of its G.D.P. on higher education than Europe or America, Sergei Guriyev, rector of Russia's New Economic School, wrote in The Moscow Times, ''Russians simply are not prepared to pay the taxes that would be necessary to finance science and education at Soviet-era levels, and no incentives have been created to attract more private funding.''So here's my prediction: You tell me the price of oil, and I'll tell you what kind of Russia you'll have. If the price stays at $60 a barrel, it's going to be more like Venezuela, because its leaders will have plenty of money to indulge their worst instincts, with too few checks and balances. If the price falls to $30, it will be more like Norway. If the price falls to $15 a barrel, it could become more like America -- with just enough money to provide a social safety net for its older generation, but with too little money to avoid developing the leaders and institutions to nurture the brainpower of its younger generation.Op-Ed ColumnistWatching the Bush team wrestle with Iran, North Korea and Iraq reminds me of something that used to be said of the Reagan administration: The right hand never knew what the far right hand was doing.In fact, my bet is that when the inside history of the Bush team is written, we will discover that, contrary to its carefully managed image of a disciplined core operating from consistent, conservative principles, it has actually been one of the most internally divided administrations -- ever.The only thing the Bush folks all agreed on was that they would never do anything Bill Clinton did. Beyond that, it's been a food fight. The trial of Scooter Libby, with its testimony about wars between the V.P.'s office and the White House, the White House and the C.I.A., and everyone against the State Department, proves that beyond a reasonable doubt.When the former Bush U.N. ambassador John Bolton trashed the president's recent deal with North Korea as a ''charade,'' though, he highlighted the biggest internal division of all within the Bush team: how to deal with rogue regimes like Iran, North Korea and Saddam's Iraq -- whether to go for regime change or behavior change.On Iran and North Korea, ''this administration does not have clear policies, it has competing impulses,'' said Robert Litwak of the Wilson Center, who just published a smart book on this theme: ''Regime Change: U.S. Strategy Through the Prism of 9/11.'' ''The administration's mantra is 'all options are on the table.' But the dilemma is that too many objectives are on the table as well.''Because this administration was divided for so long on Iran and North Korea, over regime change or behavior change, it got neither. All it got was that Iran and North Korea both went out and bought Bush insurance: a nuclear weapons program.President Bush obviously recognizes that and is now trying to remedy it. Bill Clinton was criticized for taking more golf mulligans -- do-overs -- than any other president. Mr. Bush will be remembered for taking more foreign policy mulligans than any other president.On North Korea, the president has finally decided to focus purely on changing behavior. He struck a very sensible deal last week with Kim Jong Il to take his country off our terrorism list and normalize relations, provided Mr. Kim gives up his nukes.But we could have had a similar deal years ago -- when North Korea had only two nukes -- had the Bush team not been wrangling with itself over regime change or behavior change. While it wrangled, Mr. Kim built up his nuclear arsenal, adding six to 12 more bombs. If this deal is carried out, which is still uncertain, the wasted years will not have been a disaster. If it isn't carried out, they will have been very costly.Why do you think that a year after Mr. Bush told us we were ''addicted to oil'' we still have no serious plan to end that addiction? Because the market fundamentalists in his White House -- led by Dick Cheney, who opposes any government effort to impose carbon caps or taxes to promote alternative energies, à la California -- keep blocking the market pragmatists who do. And Mr. Bush won't intervene.The irony of Iraq is that it's the one place where Mr. Bush decisively chose regime change, but he then executed it so poorly, with insufficient troops, that Iraq never stood a chance. If Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney had spent as much time plotting the toppling of Saddam Hussein as they did the toppling of Colin Powell, Iraq today would be Switzerland. Today's Bush troop surge in Iraq is just another mulligan -- the president's trying to do in 2007 what he should have done in 2003. In between, we've paid a huge price.How about we avoid a mulligan on Iran? Let's put a clear deal on the table: full diplomatic relations, security guarantees and thousands of student visas if Iran puts its nuclear program under U.N. inspection and stops supporting terrorism. If not: more sanctions and isolation. Such an offer would at least get us some leverage, unite us more with our allies outside Iran, energize our allies inside Iran and force some excruciating choices on Iran's leaders.''Resolving the contradiction in Washington will sharpen the contradiction in Tehran,'' Mr. Litwak argued. ''Taking regime change off the table in America will put behavior change on the table in Iran.''I guess we should be thankful that Mr. Bush is trying to fix some of his mistakes, but we have paid a huge, unnecessary price for his learning curve. Which is why it's always best to get it right the first time. The best golfers never take mulligans, and the best presidents never need them.Op-Ed ColumnistYes, it's true, a picture is worth a thousand words -- but some are worth a whole dictionary. I came across one the other day on BBC.com. The story was headlined ''Israeli Minister in Vision Gaffe.''Next to it is a picture showing Israel's defense minister, Amir Peretz, inspecting troops on the Golan Heights alongside Israel's military chief of staff, Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi. Both men are peering into the distance through binoculars, but with one big difference: Mr. Peretz was watching the maneuvers through binoculars with the lens caps still on.''According to the photographer,'' the BBC reported, ''Mr. Peretz looked through the capped binoculars three times, nodding as Gen. Ashkenazi explained what was in view.''Oh my, I'd rather misspell ''potato'' on national TV than be remembered for that.That picture is so evocative not only because Mr. Peretz -- a former labor organizer -- has already been savagely criticized for being out of his depth as defense minister. It's also because much of Israel's leadership seems to have blinded itself lately with all sorts of bizarre and criminal behavior.Where do I start? Israel's police commissioner just resigned after an investigative committee criticized his actions in a 1999 case involving an Israeli crime family. His resignation came in the wake of a rape allegation against Israel's president, Moshe Katsav, as well accusations of corruption against Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the suspension of his office director, whose house arrest is part of a widening investigation into the Tax Authority -- whose chief also just resigned under a cloud. The finance minister is being questioned about embezzlement at a nonprofit, and the former justice minister has been convicted of indecent behavior for kissing a female soldier against her will. There's more, but I don't have space.Here is the really bizarre thing: Israel's economy -- particularly its high-tech sector -- has never been better.''The economy is blooming, growing in the last quarter of 2006 by almost 8%,'' said Sever Plocker of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, who is one of Israel's top economics writers. ''Foreign direct investment is flowing in at unprecedented rate -- $13.4 billion in 2006. The high-tech sector exports are approaching $18 billion, and the stock exchange is at an all-time high. The shekel is stronger than ever, the inflation nonexistent. Interest rates are lower than in U.S. or Britain, the budget deficit less than 1% of G.D.P., and the balance of payments is positive, which means Israel achieved its economic independence and is actually a net creditor to the rest of the world.''In short, we never had it so good in the economy.''Yossi Vardi, one of the founding fathers of Israel's high-tech industry, told me that in the last month alone, four start-ups that he was an investor in were sold: one to Cisco, one Microsoft, and two to Israeli companies. ''In the last nine months I've probably invested in at least nine new companies,'' added Mr. Vardi, all started by ''kids 25 to 35 years old.''So maybe Israel doesn't need any cabinet ministers? It's not so simple. When the cabinet is so weak, no peace deal is likely with the Palestinians because no leader has the strength to push it through -- and that is a ticking time bomb. Moreover, high-tech doesn't employ a lot of people, and if the cabinet that should be looking out for the rest of Israel is hobbled -- another bomb is ticking.''Almost half of the population does not enjoy the boom,'' Mr. Plocker said, noting these statistics: The unemployment rate is 8.3 percent. Israel's poverty rate is still the highest in the West, by far: 24.4 percent of the entire population and 35.2 percent of all children are described as poor, living under the official ''poverty line.'' In the Arab and the ultra-Orthodox Jewish sectors, child poverty is especially high: more than 50 percent. The real income of the poorest quarter of Israelis is lower than six years ago.''There is a growing feeling that something is deeply rotten in the Israeli political system,'' Mr. Plocker e-mailed, ''as it can't deliver a decent social policy -- reducing poverty, inequality and unemployment -- even during the good times.''Tom, I never saw in the streets of Israel such a total contempt for the government by almost everybody -- the poor and the rich, the Jews and the Arabs, the left, the right and the collapsing center. This is the essence of our situation -- a contrast between the 'you never had it so good' economy and the 'you never had it so bad' government. This is the spring of our discontent. Excuse me for being rather lengthy, but it hurts.''Op-Ed ColumnistOn Feb. 20, The A.P. reported from Afghanistan that a suicide attacker disguised as a health worker blew himself up near ''a crowd of about 150 people who had gathered for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to open an emergency ward at the main government hospital in the city of Khost.'' A few days later, at a Baghdad college, a female Sunni suicide bomber blew herself up amid students who were ready to sit for exams, killing 40 people.Stop and think for a moment how sick this is. Then stop for another moment and listen to the silence. The Bush team is mute. It says nothing, because it has no moral authority. No one would listen. Mr. Bush is losing a P.R. war to people who blow up emergency wards. Europeans are mute, lost in their delusion that this is all George Bush's and Tony Blair's fault.But worst of all, Muslims, the very people whose future is being killed, are also mute. No surge can work in Iraq unless we have a ''moral surge,'' a counternihilism strategy that delegitimizes suicide bombers. The most important restraints are cultural, societal and religious. It takes a village -- but the Arab-Muslim village today is largely silent. The best are indifferent or intimidated; the worst quietly applaud the Sunnis who kill Shiites.Nobody in the Arab world ''has the guts to say that what is happening in Iraq is wrong -- that killing schoolkids is wrong,'' said Mamoun Fandy, director of the Middle East program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ''People somehow think that killing Iraqis is good because it will stick it to the Americans, so Arabs are undermining the American project in Iraq by killing themselves.''The world worries about highly enriched uranium, but ''the real danger is highly enriched Islam,'' Mr. Fandy added. That is, ''highly enriched Sunnism'' and ''highly enriched Shiism'' that eats away at the Muslim state, the way Hezbollah is trying to do in Lebanon or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt or Al Qaeda everywhere.One result: there's no legitimate, decent, accepted source of Arab-Muslim authority today, no center of gravity ''for people to anchor their souls in,'' Mr. Fandy said. In this welter of confusion, the suicide bombers go uncondemned or subtly extolled.Arab nationalist media like Al Jazeera ''practically tell bin Laden and his followers, 'Bravo,' '' Mr. Fandy said. ''The message sent to bin Laden is that 'You are doing to the West what we want done, but we can't do it.' This is the hidden message that the West is not privy to. Unless extreme pressure is applied on Muslims all over the world to come up with counter-fatwas and pronounce these men as pariahs, very little will happen in fighting terrorism.''''The battleground in the Arab world today is not in Palestine or Lebanon, but in the classrooms and newsrooms,'' Mr. Fandy concluded. That's where ''the software programmers'' reside who create symbolic images and language glorifying suicide bombers and make their depraved acts look legitimate. Only other Arab-Muslim programmers can defeat them.Occasionally an honest voice rises, giving you a glimmer of hope that others will stand up. The MEMRI translation Web site (memri.org) just posted a poem called ''When,'' from a Saudi author, Wajeha al-Huwaider, that was posted on Arab reform sites like www.aafaq.org.When you cannot find a single garden in your city, but there is a mosque on every corner -- you know that you are in an Arab country.When you see people living in the past with all the trappings of modernity -- do not be surprised, you are in an Arab country.When religion has control over science -- you can be sure that you are in an Arab country.When clerics are referred to as ''scholars'' -- don't be astonished, you are in an Arab country.When you see the ruler transformed into a demigod who never dies or relinquishes his power, and nobody is permitted to criticize -- do not be too upset, you are in an Arab country.When you find that the large majority of people oppose freedom and find joy in slavery -- do not be too distressed, you are in an Arab country.When you hear the clerics saying that democracy is heresy, but seizing every opportunity provided by democracy to grab high positions -- do not be surprised, you are in an Arab country.When you discover that a woman is worth half of what a man is worth, or less -- do not be surprised, you are in an Arab country.When land is more important than human beings -- you are in an Arab country.When fear constantly lives in the eyes of the people -- you can be certain you are in an Arab country.Op-Ed ColumnistI haven't kept count, but it seems to me that the number of times I've seen President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney give speeches about the Iraq war using smiling soldiers as their backdrops have been, well, countless. You'd think that an administration that has been so quick to exploit soldiers as props -- whether it was to declare ''Mission Accomplished'' on an naval vessel or to silence critics by saying their words might endanger soldiers in battle -- would have been equally quick to spare no expense in caring for those injured in the fight.The squalid living conditions and red tape that have been inflicted on some recovering Iraq war veterans at Walter Reed hospital and elsewhere -- which have been spotlighted by The Washington Post -- are shocking in their detail, but not surprising. They are one more manifestation -- like insufficient troops, postwar planning and armor -- of a war that was really important to get right but really hard, which the Bush team thought was really important and would be really easy.Mr. Bush summoned the country to D-Day and prepared the Army, the military health system, military industries and the American people for the invasion of Grenada.From the start, the Bush team has tried to keep the Iraq war ''off the books'' both financially and emotionally. As Larry Diamond of Stanford's Hoover Institution said to me: ''America is not at war. The U.S. Army is at war.'' The rest of us are just watching, or just ignoring, while the whole fight is carried on by 150,000 soldiers and their families.In an interview last Jan. 16, Jim Lehrer asked President Bush why, if the war on terrorism was so overwhelmingly important, he had never asked more Americans ''to sacrifice something.'' Mr. Bush gave the most unbelievable answer: ''Well, you know, I think a lot of people are in this fight. I mean, they sacrifice peace of mind when they see the terrible images of violence on TV every night.''Sacrifice peace of mind watching TV? What kind of crazy thing is that to say? Leadership is about enabling and inspiring people to contribute in time of war so the enemy has to fight all of us -- not insulating the public so the enemy has to fight only a few of us.If you want to compare President Bush in this regard with Presidents Roosevelt or Wilson, pick up a copy of Robert Hormats's soon-to-be-published book: ''The Price of Liberty: Paying for America's Wars.''''In every major war that we have fought, with the exception of Vietnam, there was an effort prior to the war or just after the inception to re-evaluate tax and spending policies and to shift resources from less vital national pursuits to the strategic objective of fighting and winning the war,'' said Mr. Hormats, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs (International). He quotes Roosevelt's 1942 State of the Union address, when F.D.R. looked Americans in the eye and said: ''War costs money.  That means taxes and bonds and bonds and taxes. It means cutting luxuries and other nonessentials. In a word, it means an 'all-out' war by individual effort and family effort in a united country.''Ever heard Mr. Bush talk that way? After Pearl Harbor, Mr. Hormats noted, Roosevelt vowed to mobilize U.S. industry to produce enough weapons so we would have a ''crushing superiority'' in arms over our enemies. Four years after the start of the Iraq war, this administration has still not equipped all our soldiers with the armor they need.As retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton pointed out, last year, because of spending in Iraq, the Army had a $530 million budget shortfall for posts, so facilities got squeezed. If Americans had been asked to pay a small tax to fill that gap, they would have overwhelmingly checked that box. They would have also paid a ''Patriot Tax'' of 50 cents a gallon to raise the money and diminish our dependence on oil. But no one asked them to do anything other than ''sacrifice peace of mind.''If you want to help and don't want to wait for the White House bugle, here are some places to start: (1) Coalition to Salute America's Heroes (www.saluteheroes.org), (2) the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund (www.fallenheroesfund.org), (3) the Fisher Houses (www.fisherhouse.org) and (4) the Walter Reed Society (www.walterreedsociety.org). And one I know personally from my hometown, Minnesotans' Military Appreciation Fund (www.thankmntroops.org).We can get just about everything wrong in Iraq, and pretty much have, but we've got to take first-class care of those who've carried the burden of this war. It's that simple.Op-Ed ColumnistThere aren't a lot of environmental groups with their own investment bank consultants, so when you hear that Environmental Defense has just hired the boutique Wall Street firm Perella Weinberg Partners, you know that we're in a new world. Every college activist should study this story, because it is the future. In the old days, when activists wanted something done, they held a sit-in or organized a protest march. Now they hire an investment bank.O.K., maybe every activist group can't afford Goldman Sachs, but such groups should nevertheless analyze how Environmental Defense and the Natural Resources Defense Council used the Internet and the market to save the planet from tons of CO2. The story started last year when a giant Texas power company, TXU, announced plans to build 11 coal-fired, CO2-belching power plants, raising the ire of environmentalists worried about climate change. Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense, which has an office in Texas, wrote to John Wilder, TXU's chairman, and asked for a meeting, but was brushed off. TXU made it clear that it was on a fast track to build its plants and had the governor of Texas on its side.Talk about not knowing what world you're living in.So Environmental Defense and its allies turned to the Web and created the Stoptxu.com Web site, which put out regular electronic newsletters on the TXU plans and built a national constituency opposed to the deal. They also took TXU to court.None of that might have been enough, though, had the big buyout firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group not teamed up to offer to buy TXU in February -- a deal valued at $45 billion that would be the biggest leveraged buyout ever. But there was a catch: ''The buyers did not want to take over a company enmeshed in a war with environmentalists,'' Mr. Krupp said, ''so they came to us and said, 'We only want to go forward if you and NRDC will praise what we are trying to do here.' '' Mr. Krupp and NRDC were ready to engage, but only if the deal could be made more climate-friendly.''The negotiations involved talks over 10 days,'' Mr. Krupp said, ''and the key session was compressed into 17 hours in the Oriental hotel in San Francisco from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. the next morning.''Eventually, the private equity group agreed to cut the number of new TXU coal plants from 11 to 3, to support a U.S. cap on greenhouse gas emissions and to commit TXU to plowing $400 million into energy-efficiency programs and doubling its purchase of wind power. In return, the environmentalists blessed the deal, but Mr. Krupp also hired Perella Weinberg to negotiate the fine print.That is a pretty good day's work for people who had no money on the table. There are a lot of lessons here.First, Mr. Krupp said, ''what is the message when the largest buyout in history is made contingent [by the buyers] on winning praise for its greenhouse gas plan?  The markets are ahead of the politicians. The world has changed, and these guys see it.''TXU not only didn't understand that the world was getting green; it didn't understand that the world was getting flat. ''Going online,'' Mr. Krupp said, ''we shifted this from a local debate over generating electricity to a national debate over capping and reducing carbon emissions.'' So, what TXU had hoped would be just a local skirmish was instead watched on computer screens in every global market.The Internet age is an age of transparency, when more people than ever can see right into your business and judge you by your deeds, not words. TXU could not manage its reputation by just hiring a P.R. firm and issuing a statement -- because, thanks to the Internet, too many little people could talk back or shape TXU's image on a global basis through the Web, for free.''The reputations of companies are going to be less determined by the quality of their P.R. people and more by their actual actions -- and that empowers more of an honest debate on the merits,'' said Mr. Krupp, adding, ''It's just harder to keep bad environmental news secret and expect the public to sit on its hands in the Internet era.''Message to young activists: If you do your homework, have your facts right and the merits on your side, and then build a constituency for your ideals through the Internet, you, too, can be at the table of the biggest deal in history. Or as Mr. Krupp puts it: the TXU example shows that truth plus passion plus the Internet ''can create an irresistible tide for change.''Paul Krugman is off today.Op-Ed ColumnistPresident Bush's Iraq surge policy is about a month old now, and there is only one thing you can say about it for certain: no matter what anyone in Congress, the military or the public has to say, it's going ahead. The president has the authority to do it and the veto power to prevent anyone from stopping him. Therefore, there's only one position to have on the surge anymore: hope that it works.Does this mean that Democrats in Congress who are trying to shut down the war and force a deadline should take the advice of critics and shut up and let the surge play out?No, just the opposite. I would argue that for the first time we have -- by accident -- the sort of balanced policy trio that had we had it in place four years go might have spared us the mess of today. It's the Pelosi-Petraeus-Bush troika.I hope the Democrats, under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, keep pushing to set a deadline for withdrawal from Iraq, because they are providing two patriotic services that the Republicans failed to offer in the previous four years: The first is policy discipline. Had Republicans spent the previous four years regularly questioning Don Rumsfeld's ignorant bromides and demanding that the White House account for failures in Iraq, we might have had the surge in 2003 -- when it was obvious we did not have enough troops on the ground -- rather than in 2007, when the chances of success are much diminished.Because the Republicans controlled the House and Senate, and because many conservatives sat in mute silence the last four years, the administration could too easily ignore its critics and drag out policies in Iraq that were not working. With the Democrats back in Congressional control, that is no longer possible.The other useful function Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues are performing is to give the president and Gen. David Petraeus, our commander in Iraq, the leverage of a deadline without a formal deadline. How so? The surge can't work without political reconciliation among Iraqi factions, which means Sunni-Shiite negotiations -- and such negotiations are unlikely to work without America having the ''leverage'' of telling the parties that if they don't compromise, we will leave. (Deadlines matter. At some point, Iraqis have to figure this out themselves.)Since Mr. Bush refuses to set a deadline, Speaker Pelosi is the next best thing. Do not underestimate how useful it is for General Petraeus to be able to say to Iraqi politicians: ''Look guys, Pelosi's mad as hell -- and she has a big following! I don't want to quit, but Americans won't stick with this forever. I only have a few months.''Speaker Pelosi: Keep the heat on.As for General Petraeus, I have no idea whether his military strategy is right, but at least he has one -- and he has stated that by ''late summer'' we should know if it's working. As General Petraeus told the BBC last week, ''I have an obligation to the young men and women in uniform out here, that if I think it's not going to happen, to tell them that it's not going to happen, and there needs to be a change.''We need to root for General Petraeus to succeed, and hold him to those words if he doesn't -- not only for the sake of the soldiers on the ground, but also so that Mr. Bush is not allowed to drag the war out until the end of his term, and then leave it for his successor to unwind.But how will General Petraeus or Congress judge if the surge is working? It may be obvious, but it may not be. It will likely require looking beneath the surface calm of any Iraqi neighborhood -- where violence has been smothered by the surge of U.S. troops -- and trying to figure out: what will happen here when those U.S. troops leave? Remember, enough U.S. troops can quiet any neighborhood for a while. The real test is whether a self-sustaining Iraqi army and political consensus are being put in place that can hold after we leave.It will also likely require asking: Are the Shiite neighborhoods quieting down as a result of reconciliation or because their forces are just lying low so the U.S. will focus on whacking the Sunnis -- in effect, carrying out the civil war on the Shiites' behalf, so that when we leave they can dominate more easily?When you're sitting on a volcano, it is never easy to tell exactly what is happening underneath -- or what will happen if you move. But those are the judgments we may soon have to make. In the meantime, since Bush is going to be Bush, let Pelosi be Pelosi and Petraeus be Petraeus -- and hope for the best. For now, we don't have much choice.Op-Ed ColumnistIs Saudi Arabia becoming the new Egypt?That's a question you hear more and more these days in Arab circles, as Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah becomes more diplomatically active and Egypt, the traditional leader of the Arab world, becomes more diplomatically passive.In recent months, we've seen Saudi Arabia publicly blast Hezbollah for launching an unprovoked war on Israel; we've seen King Abdullah forge a cease-fire between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza; we've seen him try to tame Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and there are rumors that a top Saudi official met with Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert. That meeting was apparently in preparation for the Arab summit in Riyadh, March 28-29, which King Abdullah will be hosting to revive his February 2002 peace overture to Israel of full normalization of relations in return for full withdrawal from the occupied territories.Since Egypt, for now, seems to be adrift, and the Saudis seem to be afloat in oil revenues, it's not surprising to see Saudi Arabia becoming more assertive. It could have real benefits -- given the Saudis' standing in the Muslim world -- provided that the leader of Saudi Arabia is ready to do what the leader of Egypt did when it comes to making peace with Israel.What the moribund Israeli-Palestinian talks need most today is an emotional breakthrough. Another Arab declaration, just reaffirming the Abdullah initiative, won't cut it. If King Abdullah wants to lead -- and he has the integrity and credibility to do so -- he needs to fly from the Riyadh summit to Jerusalem and deliver the offer personally to the Israeli people. That is what Egypt's Anwar Sadat did when he forged his breakthrough. If King Abdullah did the same, he could end this conflict once and for all.I would humbly suggest the Saudi king make four stops. His first stop should be to Al Aksa Mosque in East Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam. There, he, the custodian of Mecca and Medina, could reaffirm the Muslim claim to Arab East Jerusalem by praying at Al Aksa.From there, he could travel to Ramallah and address the Palestinian parliament, making clear that the Abdullah initiative aims to give Palestinians the leverage to offer Israel peace with the whole Arab world in return for full withdrawal. And he might add that whatever deal the Palestinians cut with Israel regarding return of refugees or land swaps -- so some settlements might stay in the West Bank in return for the Palestinians getting pieces of Israel -- the Arab world would support.From there, King Abdullah could helicopter to Yad Vashem, the memorial to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. A visit there would seal the deal with Israelis and affirm that the Muslim world rejects the Holocaust denialism of Iran. Then he could go to the Israeli parliament and formally deliver his peace initiative.Of course, I have no illusions about this. But is it any more illusory than thinking that the incrementalism of the last seven years is going to get anywhere? Now that's a fantasy. Yes, Al Qaeda would denounce King Abdullah. What else is new? The Saudi ruling family is going to have to decide: Is it going to spend the rest of its days tiptoeing around Al Qaeda, or is it going to confront it -- ideologically -- head on? Many more Muslims would applaud the Saudi king for such an overture. And I have no doubt that Israel's majority, which was ready to evacuate Gaza for nothing, would demand that the Israeli government respond positively to an Abdullah initiative delivered in this way.This would also be a vehicle to tell Hamas to put up or shut up. It is one thing for Hamas to reject the Oslo peace accords. But how could it reject a peace overture to Israel presented by Saudi Arabia?King Abdullah first unveiled his peace proposal in an interview he and I did in his home in Riyadh in 2002. As we sat by his desk, he told me he was motivated to propose full peace for full withdrawal to the Israelis because ''I wanted to find a way to make clear to the Israeli people that the Arabs don't reject or despise them. But the Arab people do reject what their leadership is now doing to the Palestinians, which is inhumane and oppressive. And I thought of this as a possible signal to the Israeli people.''Well, it is time to go beyond signals. If the Saudi king just wants to score some points, he will hold the Arab summit, re-issue the peace plan and go home. If he wants to make history and make peace, he will hold the Arab summit, re-issue the peace plan and deliver it in person.Paul Krugman is off today.Op-Ed ColumnistSometimes you read something about this administration that is just so shameful it takes your breath away. For me, that was the March 20 article in this paper detailing how a House committee had just released documents showing ''hundreds of instances in which a White House official who was previously an oil industry lobbyist edited government climate reports to play up uncertainty of a human role in global warming or play down evidence of such a role.''The official, Philip A. Cooney, left government in 2005, after his shenanigans were exposed in The Times, and was immediately hired by, of course, Exxon Mobil. Before joining the White House, he was the ''climate team leader'' for the American Petroleum Institute, the main oil industry lobby arm.The Times article, by Andrew Revkin and Matthew Wald, noted that Mr. Cooney said his past work opposing restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions on behalf of the oil industry had ''no bearing'' on his actions at the White House. ''When I came to the White House,'' he testified, ''my sole loyalties were to the president and his administration.'' (How about loyalty to scientific method?) Mr. Cooney, who has no scientific background, said he had based his editing on what he had seen in good faith as the ''most authoritative and current views of the state of scientific knowledge.''Let's see, of all the gin joints. Of all the people the Bush team would let edit its climate reports, we have a guy who first worked for the oil lobby denying climate change, with no science background, then went back to work for Exxon. Does it get any more intellectually corrupt than that? Is there something lower that I'm missing?I wonder how Mr. Cooney would have edited the recent draft report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, written and reviewed by 1,000 scientists convened by the World Meteorological Society and the U.N. It concluded that global warming is ''unequivocal,'' that human activity is the main driver, and that ''changes in climate are now affecting physical and biological systems on every continent.''I am not out to promote any party, but reading articles like the Cooney one makes me say: Thank goodness the Democrats are back running the House and Senate -- because, given its track record, this administration needs to be watched at all times.But I also say thank goodness for the way Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has built a Republican-Democratic coalition in California to blunt climate change. The governor is not only saving the Republican Party from being totally dominated by climate cranks, like Senator James Inhofe, and hacks-for-hire, like Cooney, but he also is creating a bipartisan template for dealing with climate change that will be embraced by Washington as soon as the Bush team is gone. I went out to Sacramento to interview the ''Governator'' a few weeks ago.''The debate is over,'' he said to me. ''I mean, how many more thousands and thousands of scientists do we need to say, 'We have done a study that there is global warming?' ''What is ''amazing for someone that does not come from a political background like myself,'' said Governor Schwarzenegger, is that ''this line is being drawn'' between Democrats and Republicans on climate change. ''You say to yourself: 'How can it be drawn on the environment?' But it is. But the great thing is more and more Republicans are coming on board for this. Seeing how important this is. And more and more Democrats and Republicans are working together.  I said in my inaugural address: 'There isn't such a thing as Republican clean air or Democratic clean air. We all breathe the same air.' Let's get our act together, fix this problem and fight global warming.''Last September, Governor Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act, requiring California to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020.''Everybody recognized that it was so important that we should not argue over philosophy -- that we Republicans believe in this and we Democrats believe in this and get nothing done,'' he said. ''We did it carefully.  We gave it enough ramp-up time to start in the year 2012 and by the year 2020 we want to hit that level. I am a business-friendly guy. I'm all about economic growth. I am not here to harm businesses. I am here to make businesses boom, but let's also protect our environment. Let's make our air clean. Let's make our water clean. And let's fight global warming because we know now that this is a major danger, that this is not a debate anymore.''Op-Ed ColumnistIn the Middle East today, home of the invention of algebra, a new math seems to have taken over. It is subtraction by addition. It goes like this: Add more trips to the region by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who doesn't seem to have any coherent strategy -- to an emotionally stale, restated Saudi peace overture to Israel, and combine it with a cynical Hamas-Fatah cease-fire accord and an Israeli prime minister so unpopular his poll ratings are now lower than the margin of error, and you'll find that we're actually going backward -- way back, back to the pre-Oslo era.Only the bad guys make history in the Middle East today. Only the bad guys have imagination and resolve. Arab, Palestinian and Israeli ''moderates'' are just watching. Their leaders have never been weaker, and America has never been more feckless in framing clear choices to spur them to action.We could be and should be doing better. Nearly seven years ago, President Bill Clinton put forward something called the ''Clinton plan'' for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. For the first time, the U.S. laid out its own detailed design of a fair deal between the parties. That plan called for Israel to give up 95 percent of the West Bank, Gaza and Arab East Jerusalem; for Palestinian refugees to be able to return to Palestinian areas but not to Israel; for the most populated Jewish settlements around Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to remain in place and the others to be removed; and for Palestinians to be compensated for those settlements with land swaps and other arrangements from Israel.Yes, Yasir Arafat rejected it at the time, and even the Israelis never fully embraced the plan as it was, but everyone knew then and knows now that the Clinton plan is the only realistic framework for peace. The Bush team took the view that since Arafat wouldn't accept it, the Clinton plan was a dead letter and therefore could be and should be forever sidelined. They also put themselves on the sidelines of Arab-Israeli diplomacy for six years, rather than sell anything with the name ''Clinton'' on it.So instead of constantly telling the parties that the Clinton plan was the only viable basis for peace, and that U.S. diplomacy would be devoted to building a context for Palestinians and Israelis to act on that plan and a U.S. team to execute it, President Bush gave us scattershot visits by his secretaries of state and minimalist, stopgap measures to engineer cease-fires or talks about talks. Who can name them? ''The Mitchell plan,'' ''the quartet,'' ''the Zinni mission,'' ''the Tenet plan,'' ''the road map,'' the ''two plus four plus four framework'' and soon the ''six plus two'' framework.You can make fun all you want of Bill Clinton's ''naïve'' Middle East peace passion, notes Mr. Clinton's top negotiator, Dennis Ross, but the fact is four times more Israelis and Palestinians died fighting each other during the ''realistic,'' ''pro-Israel,'' sideline-sitting Bush years of 2001 to 2005 than in the ''naïve'' decade of intense U.S. peacemaking -- dominated by President Clinton -- from Madrid to Oslo, 1991 to 2000.Had the Bush-Rice team stuck with the Clinton plan, today, at a minimum, it would have been locked in as the only acceptable formula for peace, and at a maximum we might have gotten there. But the Bush philosophy seems to have been: ''A.B.C. -- anything but Clinton,'' said Gidi Grinstein, who heads Reut Institute, Israel's premier strategy policy group. ''But by not endorsing the Clinton parameters, we are back with plans that are much worse.''Indeed, all that is on the table now is the restated Saudi peace initiative, calling for full peace with Israel after full withdrawal and justice for Palestinian refugees -- with no maps, details or Arab plan for how to pursue it with Israel. And we have the Saudi-brokered Mecca peace accord between Hamas and Fatah, which doesn't even acknowledge Israel.If you read the Mecca agreement, said Mr. Ross, ''Israel appears only as an adjective, not as a noun. Israel only appears in the agreement modifying words like 'aggression' and 'occupation,' but never appears as a noun -- much less as a state to be recognized.''That is what happens when America leaves a vacuum. Others fill it with peace plans that fit their needs first and the needs of a real peace second.The Bush team reminds me of someone who buys a rundown house that comes with remodeling plans by Frank Lloyd Wright, but insists instead on using drawings submitted by the next-door neighbors. You get what you pay for. Or what you don't pay for.Paul Krugman is off today.Op-Ed ColumnistWas anybody out there checking out jobs with the U.S. post office in 2005? Do you remember when you called that 800 number to get details? Sure you do. Do you remember how the voice on the other end of the line helping you had this soft British accent with a slight African lilt? Do you know why? Because you were routed to a call center in Kenya.So maybe you weren't looking for a job, but you had just bought a new computer. And when you turned it on, you clicked the icon for one of America's biggest Internet service providers to get broadband access. But you needed someone to talk you through getting it connected -- so you called that 800 number. The techie who helped you was also a Kenyan at that same Nairobi call center.It's called KenCall. It is located in an abandoned avocado processing plant, and it is the largest of Kenya's blooming outsourcing call centers, with almost 300 employees and annual revenues that have grown to $3.5 million since it opened three years ago. If you're surprised it's here, so are most of its customers.''I was actually talking to someone in America who had just given birth and she was ordering high-speed D.S.L. for her new residence -- three or four hours after the birth,'' said Nina Nyongesa, a 25-year-old KenCall supervisor and I.T. graduate of Nairobi University. ''She said to me, 'Where are you?' I said, 'Nairobi.' And she said, 'Are you sure?' And she was really happy -- so she bought one for herself, one for her mother and one for her mother-in-law. So instead of making one sale I made three.''KenCall is one small reason that Kenya's economy grew 6 percent last year. Yes, Kenya still has all the ills of other African states -- from AIDS to abject poverty. But Kenya also now has a democratically elected government that is learning to get out of the way of Kenya's entrepreneurs and to get them the bandwidth they need to compete globally. It's way too early to declare Kenya an economic ''African Tiger,'' but something is stirring here that bears watching -- and KenCall is emblematic of it.The company was started by the half-English, half-Kenyan Nicholas Nesbitt, his brother Eric and his brother-in-law Stephen Liggins. Nicholas Nesbitt and Liggins had made successful careers on Wall Street. But after Kenya's democratic elections in 2002, they decided to come home and see if they could do good for their country and for themselves by taking advantage of Kenya's large pool of educated, English-speaking talent to break into the outsourcing industry.There was one big problem. Kenya, like the rest of East Africa, was not connected to any global undersea fiber-optic cable that would give it the cheap high-speed bandwidth of the scale needed by call centers. The Internet here all came via satellite, which is more expensive to begin with and was made even more so by the fact that the Kenyan state phone company had a monopoly.In a rare move in Africa, the Kenyan government decided to give up that monopoly and open competition for satellite-provided bandwidth -- even though it meant laying off 6,000 government workers. The competition made KenCall's business possible. The Kenyan government is now working feverishly to get connected to the global fiber-optic network, via an undersea cable, which would make bandwidth here cheap and plentiful enough for all sorts of outsourcing.KenCall opened in late 2004, taking orders for U.S. late-night TV commercials. Its Kenyan operators sold Yellow Page ads, security alarms and mortgages. But it has since grown its business to include data-entry for one of the premier Wall Street credit-rating firms and handling service calls for global banks and insurance companies. For an economy dependent on coffee, safaris and flowers, this is a real change of pace.''The concept of connecting to the outside world and attracting investors from the outside -- that has not been here before,'' remarked Stephen Ogunde, another KenCall supervisor.KenCall's employees can make in a month what half of Kenya's population makes in a year: around $350. They get health care and free transportation.Don't give up on Africa. KenCall is a reminder that with a little less government regulation, a little more democracy and a lot more bandwidth, African entrepreneurs can play this game too. ''In the old days, 'landlocked' meant you didn't have a harbor,'' said Mr. Nesbitt. ''In the new days, it means you don't have fiber broadband to the rest of the world. This whole market here is just waiting for that.''Op-Ed Columnist Maureen Dowd is on vacation.For decades, the world has asked: How do we free Africa from its yoke of poverty, disease and misgovernance? In asking Kenyans that question, I've been struck at the simple, common-sense solutions they offer. Four in particular stand out: transparency, telephones, Tergat and Kotex.Naisiae Tobiko is a 28-year-old dynamo who grew up in Kenya's Masai region. She runs a public relations firm, but when we met all she wanted to talk about was Kenya's shortage of sanitary napkins for girls. Here's why, she explained: Her family could afford to send her to school, where she thrived. As she got older, though, she started to notice something about the less well-off girls -- they missed four days of class every month, ''and I could not understand why.'' When she finally asked, they confided that they did not come to school when they were menstruating -- because their parents could not afford sanitary napkins.''They would say, 'How can I come to a place when I am bleeding?' '' she recalled. ''Some were using rags or soil or mud.'' Because of those lost school days, many eventually dropped out. So Ms. Tobiko recently teamed up with the Girl Child Network and other N.G.O.s here and started a project in the countryside to distribute free sanitary napkins. They have targeted 500,000 girls, and so far have reached 189,000. More school days means more educated women and better mothers.''We're keeping girls in school,'' said Ms. Tobiko. If women get education, ''we want nothing else,'' she added. ''We will fight our way into every field, but we need the main key -- which is education.''Kenya first began holding multiparty elections in 1992, and its next national election is slated for December. (By the way, Kenyans love the fact that Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan, is running for president of the U.S. since, they joke, someone from his Luo tribe could never get elected president of Kenya!) The field here is already crowded with presidential wannabes. But the most revealing conversation I had on this subject was with someone not running.Vimal Shah owns an oil services company in Kenya, Bidco, and he was eager to tell me that with eight months until the election he had decided to make a big investment to expand his business. So what? I said. ''People here never invest in the year before an election,'' he explained. The fear is always that the new guy will change all the rules -- often for his cronies. But Mr. Shah, like others here, believes Kenya's evolution to democracy, with more transparent rules, has now reached a point where ''even if the government changes, it won't change the rules. The politicians can't stop this.''It is striking how just the little improvement in governance here can start a torrent of cash flowing in. But so could more cellphones.Rose Lukalo Owino, a Kenyan author, told me this story: ''I was recently in Ngutani, east of Nairobi. I was reporting for a book and interviewing these women who raised goats.'' The women complained that for years they had been swindled by middlemen who would get them to sell their goats for a pittance, because the women didn't know the price in the Nairobi markets. ''But when I interviewed them, these women were holding so much money,'' said Ms. Owino. Why? Fourteen villages got together and bought one cellphone, which they now share to check the market prices in Nairobi for goats before they sell. ''They were talking to me about opening a microlending bank with their profits,'' she said.But Africa doesn't just need more phone models. It needs more role models. I met one of the best here -- Paul Tergat, the great Kenyan distance runner who's earned five world cross country championships and two Olympic silver medals. Mr. Tergat recently won a contract from the government to promote anticorruption themes. For starters, he organized some of Kenya's greatest distance runners to carry a torch from Mombasa to the Ugandan border. The torch represented a spotlight on corruption. Kenyans turned out to cheer them all along the route.He used Kenya's runners, Mr. Tergat said, because unlike politicians, when they win a medal it ''is open, and genuine, and clean, and they practiced for 10 years to get it. The message is to say to young people, 'Look here, you don't have to be corrupt. You can do it if you are patient.' ''Add all this up and you have what impresses me most here: the way Kenya's emerging democracy is unlocking Kenya's best minds to find Kenyan solutions to Kenya's problems.Op-Ed ColumnistSurely of all God's creations, none is more beautiful than the sunrise on the Masai Mara grassland, Kenya's spectacular nature reserve and a backdrop for the movie ''Out of Africa.'' The sun's ascent here is like a curtain going up on one of Mother Nature's richest ecosystems. Through the day you can be greeted by a bull elephant in hot pursuit of a cow, serenaded by tropical boubou birds, intimidated by two lionesses devouring a warthog, amused by the cattle egrets riding on the backs of African buffalos and impressed by how each small cluster of topi antelope ''assigns'' one topi to stand on a small hill and keep watch for predators while the others graze. Everything seems in perfect balance.Except  behind the curtain, deforestation, the poaching of wildlife and now climate change present a trio of threats to the Mara, which have Kenyans, and all those concerned about biodiversity, worried.Over the last 10 years, ''the weather has changed,'' explained our Masai naturalist, Daniel Memusi. ''All of a sudden it is becoming unpredictable. April has always been a rainy month -- every afternoon and all night. You expect rain, but no rain.'' If the few scattered rains this April don't become more intense, he added, the farmers who just planted their crops will have serious problems. ''This should be a very wet month for anyone who knows the Mara, but instead the rains came in January and February,'' he said.One should never extrapolate about climate change from any single ecosystem or brief period. But as The Times's environmental reporter Andrew C. Revkin recently noted, scientists say it's increasingly clear ''that worldwide precipitation is shifting away from the equator and toward the poles.''''Rainfall has changed dramatically in the last 30 years -- it is less predictable now,'' said Julius Kipng'etich, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, which manages Kenya's Noah's ark of endangered species. If climate changes bring more severe droughts and floods, and the animal migrations are disrupted, ''the brand of the Mara dies,'' added Mr. Kipng'etich, referring to Kenya's ''Lion King'' grassland. That would really hurt Kenya's economy. ''When every Kenyan meets a wild animal, they should bow and say thank you.''Kenya also has to worry about deforestation and poaching, although poaching is now under better control. Kenya's forests have been reduced from 10 percent of the country's landmass at the time of its independence in 1963 to 2 percent today, while in the same period its elephant population went from 170,000 to 30,000 and its rhino population from 20,000 to around 500. ''When you see a rhino today, you are very lucky,'' said Mr. Kipng'etich. ''Your children or grandchildren may never see one.''Climate change could worsen this. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just concluded that two-thirds of the atmospheric buildup of heat-trapping carbon dioxide has come -- in roughly equal parts -- from the U.S. and Western Europe. These countries have the resources to deal with climate change, and may even benefit from some warming. Africa accounts for less than 3 percent of global CO2 emissions since 1900, the report noted, yet its 840 million people could suffer enormously from global-warming-induced droughts and floods and have the fewest resources to deal with them.''We have a message here to tell these countries, that you are causing aggression to us by causing global warming,'' President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda told an African Union summit in Ethiopia last February. ''Alaska will probably become good for agriculture, Siberia will probably become good for agriculture, but where does that leave Africa?''A study by Oxfam, entitled ''Africa -- Up in Smoke,'' noted that in line with climate models, droughts in northwest Kenya appear to becoming more frequent. It profiled the impact on the nomadic pastoralists of Kenya's northwest Turkana region, who graze cattle, camels and goats. They've always known droughts, but because they are now more frequent, families and animals have less chance to recover.The Turkana people, said Oxfam, call this more persistent drought '' 'Atiaktiak ng'awiyei' or 'the one that divided homes' because so many families split up to survive, migrating in all directions.''It really is wrong that those least responsible for climate change should pay the most. ''My recommendation is that the biggest polluter pays,'' said Mr. Kipng'etich. ''We are one planet, one system.'' He has a point. He deserves an answer.Op-Ed ColumnistWhile in Kenya last week, my wife, Ann, a teacher, visited Mukuru-Kayaba Primary School in a Nairobi slum, where the U.S. helps finance a lunch program that keeps kids coming to class. When she returned from the school visit, she remarked to me that there was a poster on the wall of the school showing Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, during their visit to Kenya last August. The poster said: The Obamas know their H.I.V. status. Do you know yours? The senator and his wife had volunteered to be tested while in Nairobi.A few days later, my friend Robert Kerr, the U.S. Embassy public affairs officer, told me: ''Each of the section chiefs in the embassy was asked to submit names of key contacts to bring to a reception for Obama at the ambassador's residence. Mine included Rose Kimotho, at the time the leader of the Media Owners Association, and Moses Mwangi, founder of the Martin Luther King Foundation for Africa. In recent visits to their offices, I was struck by the prominence they gave to their photos with Obama. Rose had it prominently displayed on the table next to her visitors book. Moses had it on the wall near a photo of [Kenya's] President Kibaki.''Yes, Mr. Obama's father was Kenyan, but nevertheless, that poster and those pictures got me thinking: when was the last time you saw a U.S. president or politician being held up as a role model abroad? It's been awhile. And that got me thinking about Mr. Obama. It seems to me that the strongest case one could make for an Obama presidency right now is rarely articulated: it is his potential to repair the broken relationship between America and the world.As I travel around, I have never seen a president and a vice president more disliked in more places than George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Some of the animus arises from an attitude they project of not caring much about what the world thinks. Some of it is spawned by Bush-Cheney policies toward Iraq, Kyoto or the Geneva Conventions. Some of it is unfair: President Bush, for instance, has been at the forefront in combating H.I.V.-AIDS in Africa. And some is nonsense: foreigners blaming America for their own ills. (It annoys me no end to read about how China is now more popular in Asia than America -- China, which censors Google and has supported a Sudanese regime engaged in mass murder in Darfur.)But in some ways, that's the point: The Bush-Cheney team, by its own hand, has undermined its ability to talk about American principles in a way that foreigners will take seriously. They have moral clarity and no moral authority. Foreigners just have to say ''Abu Ghraib'' or ''Guantánamo,'' and that ends the discussion. It also lets the foreigners off the hook.I think Mr. Obama has the potential to force a new discussion. For now at least, he has a certain moral authority because of his life story, which makes him harder to dismiss. And while he is a good talker, he strikes me as an even better listener. It's amazing what people will let you say to them, if you just listen to them first.But being a good listener starts at home. I got back from Africa for the climax of the Don Imus controversy, a show on which I've appeared. It underscored how much work we have to do here at home in learning how to listen, talk and, yes, joke with one another across racial, gender and religious lines. My instincts on speech are always to keep the boundaries really wide and to cure speech with speech -- and with sunlight -- not censorship.But, I must say, reading the reactions this past week by some of our best African-American commentators has impressed on me how much hurting has been going on inside those wide boundaries -- and how much, with our increasingly diverse society, we need to have a talk about where the line should be today, from morning radio to hip-hop and the Internet.I wish the whole nation could have heard the conversation between Mr. Imus and the impressive Rutgers women's basketball team. We would all have learned something. But now it's gone and there's no president to moderate a wider discussion. Mr. Bush has been such a divider that he's in no position to lead. So people just fire off reactions and go back to their corners and nothing positive is built.Which brings me back to Mr. Obama. I believe that what has propelled his candidacy up to now -- more than anything -- is that many Americans have projected onto him their hunger for community, their hunger for a president with the voice, instincts and moral authority to make it so much harder for foreigners to be anti-American or for Americans to be anti-one-another.Op-Ed ColumnistLast week, I was touring northern Tanzania when our car passed the small town of Karatu and we suddenly came upon an open field splashed with colors so bright and varied it looked from afar as if someone had painted a 30-color rainbow on the landscape.As we got closer, I discovered that it was Karatu's huge clothing market. Merchants had laid out blankets piled with multicolored shirts, pants and dresses, much of it used clothing from Europe, and were hawking their goods.This was not Nordstrom. A man with a tape measure dangling from his back pocket and a megaphone in his hand was shouting: ''A thousand shillings for these trousers. It's like giving them away.'' Men and women, themselves dressed in brightly colored native Tanzanian garments, sifted through the mounds of clothing, holding shirts or slacks up against their bodies to see if they fit.Scenes like this remind you that Africa is neither all tragedy nor all renaissance. It is a diverse continent that's struggling to find its way in the global economy and has both of these extremes, but is much more in a middle place that looks like that field in Karatu: a wild, unregulated, informal, individual brand of capitalism, which we need to channel into formal companies that can grow and scale up, even with corrupt governance.Africa needs many things, but most of all it needs capitalists who can start and run legal companies. More Bill Gateses, fewer foundations. People grow out of poverty when they create small businesses that employ their neighbors. Nothing else lasts.Whenever you read about capital flowing into Africa, though, it tends to be from big lenders like the World Bank, which have very strict criteria and work on big projects, or from microfinanciers, giving out $50 to a woman to buy a sewing machine. Microfinance has a role, but many people don't want the pressure of being an entrepreneur. They want the stability and prosperity of a job created by capitalist risk takers and innovators. See India.In some ways what Africa needs most today is more ''patient'' capital to spur its would-be capitalists. Patient capital has all the discipline of venture capital -- demanding a return, and therefore rigor in how it is deployed -- but expecting a return that is more in the 5 to 10 percent range, rather than the 35 percent that venture capitalists look for, and with a longer payback period.A good example of what happens when you combine patient capital, talent and innovation in Africa is the Kenyan company Advanced Bio-Extracts (ABE), headed by Patrick Henfrey. He and his partners put together a fascinating group of both white and black African farmers and scientists to build the first company in Africa to cultivate the green leafy plant artemisia, often called sweet wormwood, and transform it into pharmaceutical grade artemisinin -- a botanical extract that is the key ingredient in a new generation of low-cost, effective malaria treatments commonly known as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Malaria still kills nearly one million people in Africa every year, more than H.I.V.-AIDS.From its factory outside Nairobi, ABE is not only processing the feedstock for the drug, but has also contracted with 7,000 farmers, most with small farms, to grow artemisia in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The crop gives farmers four times the financial yield of corn.''We are commercializing a product that had never been commercialized,'' Mr. Henfrey said. To make it possible, though, the founders had to not only scrape together all their own money, but also had to find investors, like the Swiss drug giant Novartis and the Acumen Fund, a nonprofit venture capital investor based in the U.S., to put up patient risk capital. (Banks demanded collateral that ABE did not have.)''Those little windows of support make these things happen,'' Mr. Henfrey said. ''We could not have done it otherwise.''Nthenya Mule, Acumen's Kenya country director, commented to me that the stereotype of Africa is that it is hopeless and just waiting around for the West to come to its rescue. In reality, she added, ''there are positive things happening in Africa, but they are not happening overnight, and some are happening quietly. ABE is exemplary. You will not see it as front-page news, but in 18 months they set up a factory with 160 people interfacing with 7,000 farmers and supplying one of the major pharma companies in the world.''Those stories need to be talked about. It is critical to see things in action. A pothole in the road does not require a workshop. Fill it. We need a new kind of drug -- let's go out and make it instead of let's talk about it for the hundredth time.''Op-Ed ColumnistCorrection:  April 25, 2007, Wednesday  Correction from my last column: H.I.V.-AIDS kills more people in Africa than malaria.O.K. class, it's time for another news quiz. I'll give you the question and you tell me who asked it and why it was significant. Ready? Here goes:''Mr. President, how would you rate yourself as an environmentalist? What specifically has your administration done to improve the condition of our nation's air and water supply?'' You'll never get it.  The questioner was James Hubb, a member of the audience at the second presidential debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 8, 2004.What's the significance? It was the only question about energy or environmental policy that was posed in any of the three presidential debates in 2004. Hard to believe when you consider the salience of these issues today. Is it any wonder we still don't have a serious energy policy?We can't afford to make this mistake again. In this election cycle, we need to hold a ''Green Debate,'' devoted only to energy and environmental questions. I would suggest Tulane University in New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2007 -- the second anniversary of Katrina. That would give the candidates, Republicans and Democrats, all summer to develop positions and it would give the voters all fall to examine them before the big primaries in February 2008.I would like to see each party's candidates questioned separately, so Republican voters and Democrats can each focus on their primary candidates. The questioning should be done by a three-person panel consisting of one climate scientist, one energy investor and one college student, since young people will be the ones most affected by global warming.We can't let ethanol-promoting farmers in Iowa determine our energy policy anymore by virtue of the early Iowa primary. For too long, all we've had in this country is energy politics, not energy policy, and that is why we have this incoherent mess of energy systems, standards and fuels.''A new conversation has started in the country -- a new energy economy is what the people want,'' said Carl Pope, director of the Sierra Club. To get there, though, we need to force politicians to start thinking about going ''green'' as part of our national security strategy, as a Plan B for disengaging from Iraq and still driving reform in the Middle East, as an economic opportunity, as a way to restore U.S. leadership, and as an answer for climate change.Since addressing all these issues will require a carbon tax, or a really serious cap-and-trade system, or tighter mileage and efficiency standards -- i.e., sacrifice -- we need our candidates to be talking about such things in the campaign so they have a mandate to act if elected.A group of environmental entrepreneurs, including Andrew Shapiro of GreenOrder and Jesse Fink of Marshall Street Management, just created a Web site, GreenPrimary.org, to host online forums where, after the Green Debate, voters can study the different candidates' policy positions and even vote for the one they think is most serious. ''The 2008 presidential campaign will present the first opportunity for a national candidate to make sustainability a breakthrough electoral issue,'' Mr. Shapiro argues.A new survey released last week by the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, conducted for the Center for American Progress, underscores that large majorities of independents (59 percent) and Democrats (76 percent) support action now to stop global warming and make the U.S. energy-independent, along with a significant bloc of Republicans (41 percent).''Only 27 percent of people feel that our energy policy is headed in the right direction, while 65 percent say our energy policy is seriously off on the wrong track,'' the Greenberg firm said. ''Moreover, a majority of Americans (52 percent) believes the U.S. is either falling or has fallen far behind other countries in developing clean, alternative energy. Only 14 percent of people believe we lead the world in developing these technologies.''They're right. The biggest energy deficit we have right now in America is the energy to lead on this issue -- to overcome all the entrenched interests that have tied us in knots and have left our country with what the energy expert Gal Luft calls ''the sum of all lobbies'' instead of the sum of the best energy practices.The best way to overcome that is to elevate the issue during the campaign to a level that forces everyone to put a serious energy/environment platform on the table and builds a real mandate for the next president.Correction from my last column: H.I.V.-AIDS kills more people in Africa than malaria.Op-Ed ColumnistI've been thinking about China as I read Walter Isaacson's new biography of Albert Einstein. China isn't even mentioned in the book -- ''Einstein: His Life and Universe'' -- but Mr. Isaacson's stimulating and provocative retelling of Einstein's career plays into two very hot debates about China.First, what does Einstein's life tell us about the relationship between freedom and creativity? Or to put it bluntly: Can China become as innovative as America, can it dominate the 21st century, as many predict, when China censors Google and maintains tight political controls while establishing its market economy?Second, how do we compete with China, no matter how free we are, when so many of China's young people are studying math and science and so many of ours are dropping out? Or to put it more bluntly: If Einstein were alive today and learned science the boring way it is taught in so many U.S. schools, wouldn't he have ended up at a Wall Street hedge fund rather than developing theories of relativity for a Nobel Prize?Mr. Isaacson's take on Einstein's life is that it is a testimony to the unbreakable link between human freedom and creativity.''The whole theme of the last century, and of Einstein's life,'' Mr. Isaacson said in an interview, ''is about people who fled oppression in order to go places to think and express themselves. Einstein runs away from the rote learning and authoritarianism of Germany as a teenager in the 1890s and goes to Italy and Switzerland. And then he flees Hitler to come to America, where he resists both McCarthyism and Stalinism because he believes that the only way to have creativity and imagination is to nurture free thought -- rebellious free thought.''If you look at Einstein's major theories -- special relativity, general relativity and the quantum theory of light -- ''all three come from taking rebellious imaginative leaps that throw out old conventional wisdom,'' Mr. Isaacson said. ''Einstein thought that the freest society with the most rebellious thinking would be the most creative. If we are going to have any advantage over China, it is because we nurture rebellious, imaginative free thinkers, rather than try to control expression.''My gut tells me that's right, but my mind tells me not to ignore something Bill Gates said in China the other day: that putting PCs, education and the Internet in the hands of more and more Chinese is making China not only a huge software market, ''but also a contributor to this market. Innovation here is really at a rapid pace.''Will China hit a ceiling on innovation because of its political authoritarianism? That's what we need to watch for.In the meantime, we should heed another of Mr. Isaacson's insights about Einstein: he found sheer beauty and creative joy in science and equations. If only we could convey that in the way we teach science and math, maybe we could nurture another Einstein -- male or female -- and not have to worry that so many engineers and scientists in our graduate schools are from China that the classes could be taught in Chinese.''What Einstein was able to do was to think visually,'' Mr. Isaacson explained. ''When he looked at Maxwell's equations as a 16-year-old boy, he visualized what it would be like to ride alongside a light wave and try to catch up. He realized those equations described something wondrous in reality.''By being able to visualize and think imaginatively about science, he was able to see what more academic scientists failed to see, which is that as you try to catch up with a light beam, the waves travel just as fast, but time slows down for you. It was a leap that better-trained scientists could not make because they did not have the visual imagination.''If we want our kids to learn science, we can't treat science as this boring or intimidating thing. ''We have to remind our kids  that a math equation or a scientific formula is just a brush stroke the good Lord uses to paint one of the wonders of nature,'' Mr. Isaacson said, ''and we should look at it as being as beautiful as art or literature or music.''My favorite Einstein quotation is that ''imagination is more important than knowledge.'' A society that restricts imagination is unlikely to produce many Einsteins -- no matter how many educated people it has. But a society that does not stimulate imagination when it comes to science and math won't either -- no matter how much freedom it has.So my sense, from reading Mr. Isaacson's book, is that if Einstein were alive today, he would be telling both America and China that they have homework to do.Op-Ed ColumnistCorrection:  May 5, 2007, Saturday  From Thomas L. Friedman's column on April 27: Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his ''services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect,'' not specifically for relativity.On Thursday there will be a regional conference in Egypt to discuss stabilizing Iraq, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will represent the U.S. President Bush should go instead and give this speech:I want to take this opportunity to speak to the Arab and Muslim nations gathered here today and to the world at large. I begin with a simple message: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I rushed into the invasion of Iraq. I honestly believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. I was wrong, and I now realize that in unilaterally launching the war the way I did, you all feel that I breached a bond of trust between America and the world. Not only did that alienate you from us, it made us less effective in Iraq. We had too few allies and too little legitimacy. I apologize -- sincerely.I'm most sorry, though, because my bungling of the war has prompted all of us to take our eye off the ball. I messed up the treatment so badly that people have forgotten the patient really does have a disease. Now that I've apologized, I hope you will stop fixating on me and look closely at what is happening in your backyard: the forces and pathologies that brought us 9/11 are still there and multiplying.Friends, we are losing in Iraq. But whom are we losing to? Is it to the Iraqi ''Vietcong'' -- the authentic carriers of Iraqi nationalism? No, it is not. We are being defeated by nihilistic Islamist suicide bombers, who are proliferating across the Muslim world. We are losing to people who blow up mosques, markets, hospital emergency wards and girls' schools. They don't even tell us their names, let alone offer a future.Look at the past two weeks: On Thursday, at least nine Iraqi soldiers were found dead after a suicide car bomber rammed a checkpoint. Two suicide car bombers crashed into a Kurdistan Democratic Party office in Zamar. A day earlier, a suicide bomber killed four policemen in Balad Ruz. Two days earlier, nine U.S. soldiers were killed by a pair of suicide attackers driving garbage trucks packed with explosives. A few days earlier, five bomb attacks killed nearly 200 people in Baghdad. On Monday this week, a suicide bomber blew up a funeral in Khalis, killing at least 30.That's 12 suicide bombers in a little over a week. And it's been like that every month. These suicide jihadists are so hard to defeat because they have no desire to build anything. Their only goal is to make sure that America fails in its effort to bring decent, pluralistic, progressive politics to Iraq. They will kill any number of Muslims to ensure that we fail.Do not delude yourselves that this is only about Iraq. In March, a suicide bomber blew up an Internet cafe in Morocco, and on April 10 four more suicide bombers struck there. On April 11, a pair of suicide bombers, claimed by Al Qaeda, killed 24 people or more in separate attacks in Algiers. In February, a suicide bomber in Quetta, Pakistan, blew up a courtroom, killing the judge and at least 14 other people -- the sixth suicide bombing in that country in a month. Last Friday, Saudi police arrested 172 who they said were jihadists who planned to do things like flying airplanes into oil fields. On Saturday, a suicide bomber in Pakistan killed at least 28 people while trying to blow up the interior minister.You may think that I'm more dangerous than Bin Laden and that a strong America is more dangerous than Al Qaeda. You're wrong. If we are defeated in Iraq, they'll come after you. They already are. And if we're defeated in Iraq, you'll no longer have to contend with a world of too much American power. You'll have to contend with a world of too little American power. You will not like it.Don't let your anger with me blind you to your own interests. You are holding your breath until I turn blue. But I'm not going to turn blue. You are. I want to get out of Iraq as soon as possible, but I need you Arab leaders to get off the fence. I know that you fear democracy in Iraq, but the alternative is much worse. If the jihadists win, the Arab world will have no future. I need your help in forging a settlement in Iraq and in denouncing this suicide madness from every mosque and minaret every hour of every day -- with no qualifications.And to Europe, China and Russia, I also say: Get off the fence -- I can't stabilize Iraq without your help. I don't have the resources. I know I was a jerk in stiff-arming you. Believe me, I'm over it. I'm here to listen to what you want me to do. But unless we -- the world of order -- all pull together now, the forces of disorder are going to have their way, and there is no wall that will protect you.Op-Ed ColumnistAlmost everywhere you travel these days, people are talking about their weather -- and how it has changed. Nowhere have I found this more true, though, than in Australia, where ''the big dry,'' a six-year record drought, has parched the Aussie breadbasket so severely that on April 19, Prime Minister John Howard actually asked the whole country to pray for rain. ''I told people you have to pray for rain,'' Mr. Howard remarked to me, adding, ''I said it without a hint of irony.''And here's what's really funny: It actually started to rain! But not enough, which is one reason Australia is about to have its first election in which climate change will be a top issue. In just 12 months, climate change has gone from being a nonissue here to being one that could tip the vote.In the process, Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative now in his 11th year in office, has moved from being a climate skeptic to what he calls a ''climate realist,'' who knows that he must offer programs to reduce global-warming greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, but wants to do it without economic pain or imposed targets, like Kyoto's. He is proposing emissions trading and nuclear power.The Labor Party, led by Kevin Rudd, proposes a hard target -- a 60 percent reduction in Australian CO2  emissions from 2000 levels by 2050 -- and subsidies for Aussies to retrofit their homes with energy-saving systems. The whole issue has come from the bottom up, and it has come on so quickly that neither party can be sure it has its finger on the public's pulse.''What was considered left a year ago is now center, and in six months it will be conservative -- that is how quickly the debate about climate change is moving here,'' said Michael Roux, chairman of RI Capital, a Melbourne investment firm. ''It is being led by young people around the dinner table with their parents, and the C.E.O.'s and politicians are all playing catch-up.''I asked Mr. Howard how it had happened. ''It was a perfect storm,'' he said. First came a warning from Nicholas Stern of Britain, who said climate change was not only real but could be economically devastating for Australia. Then the prolonged drought forced Mr. Howard to declare last month that ''if it doesn't rain in sufficient volume over the next six to eight weeks, there will be no water allocations for irrigation purposes'' until May 2008 for crops and cattle in the Murray-Darling river basin, which accounts for 41 percent of Australian agriculture.It was as if the pharaoh had banned irrigation from the Nile. Australians were shocked. Then the traditional Australian bush fires, which usually come in January, started in October because everything was so dry. Finally, in the middle of all this, Al Gore came to Australia and showed his film, ''An Inconvenient Truth.''''The coincidence of all those things  shifted the whole debate,'' Mr. Howard said. While he tends to focus on the economic costs of acting too aggressively on climate change, his challenger, Mr. Rudd, has been focusing on the costs of not acting. Today, Mr. Rudd said, Australian businesses are demanding that the politicians ''get a regulatory environment settled'' on carbon emissions trading so companies know what framework they will have to operate in -- because they know change is coming.When you look at the climate debate around the world, remarked Peter Garrett, the former lead singer for the Australian band Midnight Oil, who now heads the Labor Party's climate efforts, there are two kinds of conservatives. The ones like George Bush and John Howard, he said, deep down remain very skeptical about environmentalism and climate change ''because they have been someone else's agenda for so long,'' but they also know they must now offer policies to at least defuse this issue politically.And then there are conservatives like Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Cameron, the Tory Party leader in London, who understand that climate is becoming a huge defining issue and actually want to take it away from liberals by being more forward-leaning than they are.In short, climate change is the first issue in a long time that could really scramble Western politics. Traditional conservatives can now build bridges to green liberals; traditional liberals can make common cause with green businesses; young climate voters are newly up for grabs. And while coal-mining unions oppose global warming restrictions, service unions, which serve coastal tourist hotels, need to embrace them. You can see all of this and more in Australia today.Politics gets interesting when it stops raining.Op-Ed ColumnistHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, made a remarkable statement last week. He praised Israel for conducting an inquiry into last year's war with Hezbollah -- an inquiry that accused Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of ''serious failure in exercising judgment, responsibility and prudence.''Mr. Nasrallah was quoted by the BBC as saying Israelis ''study their defeat in order to learn from it,'' in contrast with the Arab regimes that ''do not probe, do not ask, do not form inquiry commissions  as if nothing has happened.''One has to be impressed by his honesty, but he did not take it all the way, since the Arab leader who most needs to be probed is Mr. Nasrallah himself. He started the war with Israel, which was a disaster for both sides. If there were an honest Arab League Inquiry Commission into the war, here is what it would say about him:On July 12, 2006, Hezbollah fighters directed by Mr. Nasrallah abducted two Israeli soldiers and killed eight others in an unprovoked attack across the Lebanon-Israel border, on the pretext of seeking a prisoner exchange. This triggered a war that killed about 1,200 Lebanese and 160 Israelis. After interviewing all relevant parties, the Arab League Commission finds Mr. Nasrallah guilty of a serious failure of judgment, responsibility and prudence -- for the following reasons.1. Mr. Nasrallah demonstrated a total failure to anticipate Israel's response to his raid. He assumed Israel would carry out the same limited retaliation it had with previous raids. Wrong. He failed to take into account the changed circumstances in Israel. The kidnapping of an Israeli soldier in Gaza a few weeks earlier, plus the fact that a new chief of staff of the Israeli Army, a new prime minister and a new defense minister had just taken office and all felt they were being tested, triggered an enormous Israeli response. Some 1,200 Lebanese died because of this gross error in judgment.2. In unilaterally launching a war against Israel, without a vote of the Lebanese cabinet -- of which Hezbollah is a member -- the militia did grievous harm to Lebanon's fragile democracy and democratization in the Arab world. All the fears that if you let an Islamist party into government it will not respect the rules of the game were fulfilled by Hezbollah.3. Iran and Syria gave Hezbollah its rockets for their own deterrence. Hezbollah was their long arm to pressure Israel into political compromises and to threaten Israel if it attacked Iran or Syria. By launching all these rockets prematurely, without strategic purpose, Hezbollah has diminished its capability and Syria's and Iran's. The commission can't find a single strategic gain from Mr. Nasrallah's actions.4. When the war started, Hezbollah's fighters were sitting right on the border with Israel, operating freely. This was a real threat to Israel. As a result of the war, Hezbollah was pushed off the border by Israel and, in its place, the U.N. inserted a new peacekeeping force of some 10,000 troops, including a big European contingent, led by France and Italy. Yes, Hezbollah still has fighters in the area, but it has lost its military infrastructure, and can't attack Israel now without getting embroiled with France and Italy -- a huge strategic loss for Hezbollah.5. Israel had allowed its ground forces to be degraded in order to invest more money in its air force's ability to deter Iran and into policing the West Bank. Hezbollah's attack exposed just how degraded Israel's army had become. As a result, Israel has embarked on a broad upgrade of its military. In any future war Arab armies will meet a much better trained and equipped Israeli force.6. Hezbollah claims that its Shiite militia, in attacking Israel, was serving the security needs of Lebanon. But Israel's response to Hezbollah's attack has resulted in billions of dollars of damage to Lebanese homes, factories and roads, with Shiite areas the worst hit and with zero security benefit to Lebanon.Lebanon has had to rely on Arab and Iranian charity to rebuild. Israel, by contrast, suffered relatively minor damage and, after the war, its economy enjoyed one of its greatest growth spurts ever, as foreigners invested a record amount in Israel's high-tech industry.In sum, Mr. Nasrallah may have won popularity for himself and Hezbollah by fighting Israel. But so what? Today, less than a year after a war that Hezbollah called a ''divine'' victory, Lebanon is weaker and Israel is stronger. That's what matters. And that is why, if the Hezbollah leader had any honor, he would resign.Op-Ed ColumnistI'm glad Democrats are keeping the pressure on President Bush for a withdrawal date from Iraq. It's the only way to keep him and Iraqis focused on the endgame. But if Democrats really want to be taken seriously on foreign affairs, they need to recognize that they have only half a policy on Iraq. And it's the easy half.You can't be in favor of setting a date to withdraw from Iraq without also being in favor of a serious energy policy to radically reduce our dependence on oil -- now. To call for withdrawing from Iraq by a set date, no matter what the situation is on the ground there -- without a serious energy plan here -- is reckless. All we would be doing is making ourselves more dependent on an even more unstable Middle East, because any U.S. withdrawal from Iraq is likely, in the short run, to be destabilizing.The Middle East today is deeply troubled. If we determine that our efforts to tilt that region in a different direction -- by building a decent Iraq -- have failed, then our efforts to minimize our exposure to that region have to begin. But the last thing we can afford to do is walk away from the Middle East militarily while remaining chained to it economically.More important, if Iraq totally fails, but we still believe it is in our interest to promote reform in the Middle East, a serious U.S. energy policy that permanently brings down the price of oil -- by developing scalable alternative energies -- is actually the best Plan B there is. You will see reform in the Arab-Muslim world only when regimes there can't survive just by extracting oil, but have to extract the talents of their people by educating, empowering and connecting them.But to hasten that day, Democrats have to be a lot more serious about energy than they have been up to now. Everyone has an energy plan for 2020. But we need one for 2007 that will start to have an impact by 2008 -- and there is only one way to do that: get the price of oil right. Either tax gasoline by another 50 cents to $1 a gallon at the pump, or set a $50 floor price per barrel of oil sold in America. Once energy entrepreneurs know they will never again be undercut by cheap oil, you'll see an explosion of innovation in alternatives.''Right now we're looking for solutions in all the wrong places,'' argues the noted oil economist Philip Verleger. ''The only way one can effectively address this problem today and get an immediate kick is by raising the price at the pump and keeping it there.'' Some of the revenue could be used to buy back the most fuel-inefficient vehicles on our roads, he added. ''The best monument to 9/11 we could erect would be a mountain of crushed gas guzzlers.''There are some hopeful signs: Chris Dodd has just broken ranks and become the first presidential candidate to issue a serious, comprehensive energy plan that includes the ''T word.'' He has called for a ''corporate carbon tax'' that would both help fight global warming emissions and raise gasoline prices.''You say the word 'tax' and people usually head for the hills,'' Mr. Dodd told me. ''But this is one where the American people can handle the truth. Unless you address the issue of price, you're not serious about moving us from Point A to Point B.''Barack Obama also just got right in Detroit's face. He went to Motown, called for much tougher fuel economy standards and bluntly told automakers and autoworkers the truth: ''For years, while foreign competitors were investing in more fuel-efficient technology for their vehicles, American automakers were spending their time investing in bigger, faster cars. Whenever an attempt was made to raise our fuel efficiency standards, the auto companies would lobby furiously against it, spending millions to prevent the very reform that could've saved their industry.'' Those are fightin' words!Finally, in a move that also merits praise, General Motors announced that it was joining other major U.S. corporations, like General Electric, and signing on to the United States Climate Action Partnership (U.S.C.A.P.), which calls for a cap-and-trade program to control carbon dioxide emissions. G.M. is the first auto company to do so.None of these go far enough, but they are all new positions and may be harbingers of a new competition in which companies and candidates try to outdo each other in being serious about energy rather than phony. That would be a big deal -- and it might give the Democrats a more comprehensive Iraq policy just in the nick of time.You can't be serious about getting out of Iraq if you're not serious about getting off oil.Op-Ed ColumnistIf you want to know why we are losing in Iraq, go back and read this story that ran on the front page of The Times on Saturday. It began like this:''Two years ago, Robin C. Ashton, a seasoned criminal prosecutor at the Department of Justice, learned from her boss that a promised promotion was no longer hers. 'You have a Monica problem,' Ms. Ashton was told. Referring to Monica M. Goodling, a 31-year-old, relatively inexperienced lawyer who had only recently arrived in the office, the boss added, 'She believes you're a Democrat and doesn't feel you can be trusted.' Ms. Ashton's ouster -- she left for another Justice Department post two weeks later -- was a critical early step in a plan that would later culminate in the ouster of nine United States attorneys last year.''Ms. Goodling would soon be quizzing applicants for civil service jobs at Justice Department headquarters with questions that several United States attorneys said were inappropriate, like who was their favorite president and Supreme Court justice. One department official said an applicant was even asked, 'Have you ever cheated on your wife?' Ms. Goodling also moved to block the hiring of prosecutors with résumés that suggested they might be Democrats, even though they were seeking posts that were supposed to be nonpartisan.''What does this have to do with Iraq? A lot. One benchmark the Bush team has been urging the Iraqi government to meet is to rescind its broad ''de-Baathification'' program -- the wholesale purging of Baathists after the fall of Saddam -- which has alienated many Sunnis and hampered national reconciliation.But while the Bush team has been lecturing the Iraqi Shiites to limit de-Baathification in Baghdad, it was carrying out its own de-Democratization in the Justice Department in Washington. We would feel that we had failed in Iraq if we read that Sunnis were being purged from Iraq's Ministry of Justice by Shiite hard-liners loyal to Moktada al-Sadr -- but the moral equivalent of that is exactly what the Bush administration was doing here. What kind of example does that set for Iraqis?And this wasn't only a Washington problem. Read Rajiv Chandrasekaran's outstanding ''Imperial Life in the Emerald City,'' which details the extent to which Americans recruited to work for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad were chosen, at times, for their loyalty toward Republicanism rather than expertise on Islamism. ''Two C.P.A. staffers said that they were asked if they supported Roe v. Wade and if they had voted for George W. Bush,'' he wrote.But this degree of partisanship -- loyalty over competence -- was destructive in a much bigger way. It also deprived the Bush team of the support it needed when things in Iraq didn't turn out to be as easy as it expected.Only a united America could have the patience and fortitude to heal a divided Iraq -- and we simply don't have that today. Why? Because George Bush and Dick Cheney asked everyone to check their politics at the door when it came to Iraq, because victory there was so important -- everyone but themselves. They argued that the war in Iraq was the central front of the central struggle of our age -- an unusual war, a war against terrorism and the pathologies that produce it -- but then they indulged in the most rancid politics as usual at home.They actually thought they could unite Iraq, while dividing America.Whenever Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney had a choice between seeking political advantage at home or acting in a bipartisan fashion to buy more unity, time and space to do all the heavy lifting needed in Iraq, they opted for political advantage.When Franklin Roosevelt fought World War II, he made a conservative Republican, Henry Stimson, his secretary of war and did all he could to hold the country together. The Bush-Cheney team, by contrast, summoned us to D-Day and then treated it like it was just another political wedge issue, whenever it suited them.It has not worked. As Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic, put it: ''You cannot govern like Winston Churchill some of the time and like Grover Norquist most of the time.''Democrats need to be careful, though, that they don't let their rage with the hypocrisy of Mr. Bush make them totally crazy, and blind them to the fact that they -- we -- still need a credible plan to deal with the very real threat to open societies posed by Islamist terrorism. But I understand that rage. After all, who can ask more soldiers to sacrifice their lives in Iraq for an administration that wouldn't even sacrifice its politics?Op-Ed ColumnistLast week, President Bush appointed a ''war czar,'' Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute, to oversee everything we're doing in Iraq and Afghanistan -- which raises the question: Who was doing this job up to now? The answer, amazingly, is no one. We're like a fine restaurant that has decided five years after it's opened -- and has lost most of its customers -- that it might be good to hire a head chef. Better late than never. General Lute comes advertised as smart and tough. Good. I hope his first memo to the president starts like this:Mr. President, if you look around the region, all those we've tried to isolate -- Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Iraqi insurgents and the Taliban -- are stronger today than they were two years ago. We have to reassess our strategy, beginning by facing up to the fact that we've fundamentally altered the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East.We brought down the hard walls that surrounded Iran by destroying Iran's two archenemies -- the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam's regime in Iraq. As a result, we are dealing today with an emboldened, resurgent Iran, which has taken advantage of our good works to expand its economic, cultural, religious and geopolitical influence into Persian-speaking western Afghanistan and into Shiite Iraq.With Saddam gone, none of the Arab states are strong enough to balance Iran. They are all either too weak or too dysfunctional. This means we have two choices. We can be the regional power balancing Iran, which will require keeping thousands of troops in the area indefinitely. Or we have to engage Tehran in a high-level dialogue, in which we focus on our mutual interests in stabilizing Afghanistan and Iraq. You have to choose, Mr. President: I can't do my job if you don't face the fact that our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and our energy gluttony -- have empowered Iran.War with Iran is not inevitable. Let me remind you how well we worked with the Iranians in Afghanistan, initially. As you recall, we had a regular cooperative dialogue between our ambassadors in Kabul. The Iranians helped to deliver us the Northern Alliance. Then they cut their financial support for their favorite warlord in Herat, Ismail Khan, so that the pro-American Afghan government could extend its authority there. When, in early 2002, we gave them the names of members of a Qaeda group operating in Meshad, Iran, they rolled them up and put them on a plane to Afghanistan. There was much more, until things went sour.I don't know who is responsible for the breakdown -- the Iranians point to your calling them part of the ''axis of evil,'' after they had helped us so much. We can point to their involvement in bombings in Saudi Arabia in 2003. But for the past few years we've been in cold war with them -- and today their proxies are beating our proxies in Lebanon, Gaza and Iraq.As Vali Nasr, author of ''The Shia Revival,'' points out: ''Stability in the Middle East is now about U.S.-Iran relations, and it is fantasy to think that we can go back to the old days where the Cairo-Riyadh-Amman axis manages the region for us.'' Iran will not allow a stable Iraq to emerge if its interests are not protected, and if the new balance of power in Iraq -- one based on a Shiite-Kurdish majority -- is not recognized.Yes, the Saudis will go nuts, but look what they've been doing: in private the Saudis tell us we can't leave Iraq and in public their king denounces our occupation there as ''illegal.'' Of course, we must protect the Saudis. But they and their Sunni allies in Iraq have to accept the new reality there, and stop treating the Shiites as a lower form of life. Then we can cut them the best deal possible. If not, they're on their own. Our kids are not going to die to restore Sunni minority rule to Iraq.At the same time, we have to open a dialogue with Hamas -- not to embrace it, but to lay out a gradual pathway that will bring it into relations with Israel. As Rashid Khalidi, Columbia University's Palestinian expert and author of ''The Iron Cage,'' points out: ''If we let the Palestinian Authority be destroyed, and then we keep Hamas isolated'' -- even though it won a democratic election that we sponsored -- ''we will end up with the hard boys, the gangs you see today on the streets of Gaza, who respond to no authority at all.''If I thought that isolating Iran and Hamas was working, I'd continue it. But it manifestly is not -- any more than isolating Castro has worked. So either we find a way to draw them in or we'll be fighting them -- and the hard boys -- in Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan for a long, long time.Op-Ed ColumnistFirst I had to laugh. Then I had to cry.I took part in commencement this year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, one of America's great science and engineering schools, so I had a front-row seat as the first grads to receive their diplomas came on stage, all of them Ph.D. students. One by one the announcer read their names and each was handed their doctorate -- in biotechnology, computing, physics and engineering -- by the school's president, Shirley Ann Jackson.The reason I had to laugh was because it seemed like every one of the newly minted Ph.D.'s at Rensselaer was foreign born. For a moment, as the foreign names kept coming -- ''Hong Lu, Xu Xie, Tao Yuan, Fu Tang'' -- I thought that the entire class of doctoral students in physics were going to be Chinese, until ''Paul Shane Morrow'' saved the day. It was such a caricature of what President Jackson herself calls ''the quiet crisis'' in high-end science education in this country that you could only laugh.Don't get me wrong. I'm proud that our country continues to build universities and a culture of learning that attract the world's best minds. My complaint -- why I also wanted to cry -- was that there wasn't someone from the Immigration and Naturalization Service standing next to President Jackson stapling green cards to the diplomas of each of these foreign-born Ph.D.'s. I want them all to stay, become Americans and do their research and innovation here. If we can't educate enough of our own kids to compete at this level, we'd better make sure we can import someone else's, otherwise we will not maintain our standard of living.It is pure idiocy that Congress will not open our borders -- as wide as possible -- to attract and keep the world's first-round intellectual draft choices in an age when everyone increasingly has the same innovation tools and the key differentiator is human talent. I'm serious. I think any foreign student who gets a Ph.D. in our country -- in any subject -- should be offered citizenship. I want them. The idea that we actually make it difficult for them to stay is crazy.Compete America, a coalition of technology companies, is pleading with Congress to boost both the number of H-1B visas available to companies that want to bring in skilled foreign workers and the number of employment-based green cards given to high-tech foreign workers who want to stay here. Give them all they want! Not only do our companies need them now, because we're not training enough engineers, but they will, over time, start many more companies and create many more good jobs than they would possibly displace. Silicon Valley is living proof of that -- and where innovation happens matters. It's still where the best jobs will be located.Folks, we can't keep being stupid about these things. You can't have a world where foreign-born students dominate your science graduate schools, research labs, journal publications and can now more easily than ever go back to their home countries to start companies -- without it eventually impacting our standard of living -- especially when we're also slipping behind in high-speed Internet penetration per capita. America has fallen from fourth in the world in 2001 to 15th today.My hat is off to Andrew Rasiej and Micah Sifry, co-founders of the Personal Democracy Forum. They are trying to make this an issue in the presidential campaign by creating a movement to demand that candidates focus on our digital deficits and divides. (See: http://www.techpresident.com.) Mr. Rasiej, who unsuccessfully ran for public advocate of New York City in 2005 on a platform calling for low-cost wireless access everywhere, notes that ''only half of America has broadband access to the Internet.'' We need to go from ''No Child Left Behind,'' he says, to ''Every Child Connected.''Here's the sad truth: 9/11, and the failing Iraq war, have sucked up almost all the oxygen in this country -- oxygen needed to discuss seriously education, health care, climate change and competitiveness, notes Garrett Graff, an editor at Washingtonian Magazine and author of the upcoming book ''The First Campaign,'' which deals with this theme. So right now, it's mostly governors talking about these issues, noted Mr. Graff, but there is only so much they can do without Washington being focused and leading.Which is why we've got to bring our occupation of Iraq to an end in the quickest, least bad way possible -- otherwise we are going to lose Iraq and America. It's coming down to that choice.Op-Ed ColumnistSince my daughter is graduating from college today, I am thinking a lot about the class of 2007 and the world they are about to enter. I'm not sure what they call this generation. Is it generation ''X'' or ''Y'' or ''Zero'' or ''Me''? Having taken part in two other commencements this season, though, and knowing enough about what my own daughter's friends are doing, I can say there is something quietly impressive about this cohort. In fact, if I were giving them a label I'd call them the ''Quiet Americans'' -- not in the cynical way Graham Greene meant it, but in a very positive sense.They are young people who are quietly determined not to let this age of terrorism curtail their lives, take away their hopes or steal the America they are about to inherit. They don't take to the streets much -- in part, I suspect, because they do a lot of their political venting online. But it seems to me that they go off and volunteer for public service or for military service with as much conviction as any generation, if not more.Four years ago, when my wife and I dropped our daughter off at college, I wrote that I was troubled that I was dropping her off into a world that was so much more dangerous than the one she had been born into -- and I worried that she would not be able to travel in the carefree way that I had when I was her age. Her two summers teaching and researching in India have cured me of that misapprehension. Now I know how my mother felt.''I don't know where these kids find lepers, but they find them and they read to them,'' said Stephen J. Trachtenberg, the departing president of George Washington University.''I've been a college president for 30 years, and these kids are more optimistic about the future than any I have seen -- maybe more than they have reason to be,'' he said. ''They still believe that the world is their oyster and go abroad with abandon. Notwithstanding everything, they remain optimistic.''In my previous column, I wrote about the number of foreign-born students who are dominating graduate science programs at our best schools, which I witnessed firsthand at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's commencement. But something else struck me at Rensselaer -- the number of R.O.T.C. grads, including women, who came up and collected their degrees in full dress uniforms.It was not only the pride with which they wore those uniforms that was palpable, but also the respect they were accorded by their classmates. I spoke to one young man who was going from graduation at Rensselaer right out to sea with the United States Navy. As bad as Iraq is, they just keep signing up. I have been equally impressed by the number of my daughter's friends who have opted to join Teach for America.And that can-do-will-do spirit is a good thing, because we will need it to preserve our democracy from those who want to steal the openness and optimism that make democracy work.When I graduated in 1975, the world was dominated by interstate rivalries and conclusive wars. The class of 2007 is graduating into a world of state-versus-gang wars and gang-versus-gang wars that are often inconclusive. Look at the Middle East today. You have gangs fighting states and armies in Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Gaza.If the dominant clash of my generation was between communism and capitalism, the dominant clash of this generation is between ''nihilism'' -- represented by suicide bombers who try to blow up hope from New York to Baghdad -- and ''optimism'' that a better social and political order can be created, and therefore service matters. That's why this generation's willingness to continue venturing into the world, whether to repair it or do business with it, is so important. It is exactly the opposite of what the nihilists want.''Triumphing over fear is the victory of the democratic citizen against the paralyzing effects of terror,'' the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi observed. ''It has to be done, though, at the level of each citizen. Just as the violence has been fragmented, so must the victory over this violence be done one by one. Leaders can help, but ultimately victory is about not letting the fear engendered by this new era paralyze you.''We have to hope, though, that the determination that characterizes these Quiet Americans extends into their adulthood, and is also shared by those who choose to be doctors, consultants, lawyers and bankers. So many big problems are going to come due on their watch -- from underfunded Social Security to health care to climate change -- that the effort needed to fix them will require them to stay involved, redouble their resolve and raise their voices.Op-Ed ColumnistMan, was I wrong about Iran.I thought this regime was powerful and self-confident, and actually felt strengthened since we destroyed its two main enemies -- the Taliban and Saddam. That could not be further from the truth. This Iranian regime is afraid of its shadow. How do I know? It recently arrested a 67-year-old grandmother, whom it accused of trying to bring down the regime by organizing academic conferences!Yes, big, tough President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- the man who shows us how tough he is by declaring the Holocaust a myth -- had his goons arrest Haleh Esfandiari, a 67-year-old scholar, grandmother and dual Iranian-U.S. citizen, while she was visiting her 93-year-old mother in Tehran. Do you know how paranoid you have to be to think that a 67-year-old grandmother visiting her 93-year-old mother can bring down your regime? Now that is insecure.It's also shameful. Haleh directs the Middle East program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. She went to Iran in December to visit her aging mother -- a trip she's made regularly for the past decade. According to her husband, Shaul Bakhash, himself a renown Iran expert in the U.S., while Haleh was traveling to the Tehran airport on Dec. 30, to return home, she was stopped by three masked, knife-wielding men -- Iran's Intelligence Ministry always needs three men and three knives when confronting a grandmother -- and they stole her belongings and her U.S. and Iranian passports.This was followed by six weeks of intermittent questioning by Iran's Ministry of Intelligence. Then, on May 7, Haleh was arrested. Yesterday, she was formally charged with ''endangering national security through propaganda against the system and espionage for foreigners,'' an Iranian spokesman said -- apparently because of her work organizing academic conferences of Iranian and U.S. experts.Why does Iran's leadership do such a thing? Because its hard-liners fear relations with the U.S. and want to scuttle the Iran-U.S. dialogue that began this week in Baghdad. Just like Castro's Cuba, Iran's mullah dictators thrive on their clash with America. The conflict gives them status among anti-American countries, our sanctions allow them to explain away their poor economic performance, and U.S. ''threats,'' both real and imagined, allow them to crush all legitimate dissent by labeling it part of a U.S. conspiracy.What to do? Obviously, one option is a military strike combined with fomenting revolution. But that could easily leave us with another unstable, failing state in the Middle East. I don't want to create another boiling Iraq. A second option would be more economic sanctions to change the regime's behavior. The third option is engagement aimed at restoring relations.Alas, the Bush Iran policy has dabbled in all three, but never committed itself to one, and, as a result, Iran's hard-liners have been strengthened. The only way out of our corner now is to get some leverage. And leverage can come only from stepped-up economic sanctions -- particularly doing something to bring down the price of oil, Iran's lifeblood -- combined with aggressive engagement, like declaring that we don't seek the toppling of the regime and that we are ready, if Iran curbs its nuclear program, to restore full diplomatic and economic ties the next day.In other words, our only hope of either changing this Iranian regime or its behavior, without fracturing the country, is through a stronger Iranian middle class that demands a freer press, consensual politics and rule of law. That is our China strategy -- and it could work even faster with Iran. The greatest periods of political change in modern Iran happened when the country was most intensely engaged with the West, beginning with the constitutional revolution in 1906.Unfortunately, the Bush strategy -- diplomatic/economic isolation plus high oil prices -- has only frozen the regime in power and transformed it from mildly repressive to a K.G.B. state with a nuclear program. So now we face an Iranian regime that is both powerful and paranoid.It has the resources to snub the world and its own people's aspirations. Yet, no matter how much this regime tries to buy off its people with oil money, it knows that many despise it. It's actually afraid of its own people more than anyone -- so afraid it even criminalizes scholarly exchanges between Iranians and Americans that the regime can't control.That's why a 67-year-old grandmother -- whose only crime is getting people together in public to talk about building a better Iran -- is such a threat.Op-Ed ColumnistSurely the most glaring contrast in American political life today is the amount of words, speeches and magazine covers devoted to the necessity of ''going green,'' ''combating climate change'' and gaining ''energy security,'' and the actual solutions being offered by our leaders to do any of these things. You could very comfortably drive a Hummer through the gap between our words and deeds.We are playing pretend -- which, when you think about it, is really troubling. Here are the facts: Our worst enemies, like Iran, have been emboldened by all their petrodollars. The vast majority of scientists tell us that global warming caused by our burning of fossil fuels is a real danger. And with three billion new consumers from India, Russia and China joining the world economy, it is inevitable that manufacturing clean, green power systems, appliances, homes and cars will be the next great global industry. It has to be, or we will not survive as a species.And yet  and yet our president and our Congress still won't give us an energy bill that would create the legal and economic framework to address these issues at the speed and scale required.If you were President Bush, wouldn't you want to leave behind something big, bold and important on energy, just in case -- you know, just in case -- Iraq doesn't turn out so well?I sure would. But the president still has not challenged Congress or the country to undertake a radical departure on energy. So we still have only ''energy politics,'' not ''energy policy.'' Like previous energy bills, the packages working through the House and Senate today represent more ''the sum of all lobbies,'' as the energy expert Gal Luft, co-chairman of the Set America Free Coalition, puts it, not the sum of our best ideas.Some lawmakers are pushing corn ethanol from Iowa, either because they hail from that area and are looking to give more welfare to farmers by wasting money on an alternative fuel that will never reach the scale of what is needed, or because they plan to run in the Iowa caucuses. Others are pushing huge subsidies to turn coal into gasoline, because they come from coal states. Those who don't come from Michigan want higher mileage standards imposed on Detroit, while those who come from Michigan prefer to continue their assisted suicide of the U.S. auto industry by blocking tougher mileage requirements.''The only green that they are serious about in Congress right now is the one with Ben Franklin's picture on it,'' Mr. Luft said.Yes, it is helpful that Mr. Bush expressed a desire last week to work with other nations to limit greenhouse gases. His bully pulpit matters. But no one will -- or should -- take him seriously unless his government first leads by example. What would that look like? It has to start with a clear, long-term price signal. That is, a carbon tax or gasoline tax -- or a cap and trade system with a binding national ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions -- which would set a price for dumping carbon into the atmosphere or driving a gas-guzzling car.Get Washington to signal that gasoline is never going to retreat from a level of $3.50 or $4 a gallon -- and that wind and solar subsidies will be there for a decade, not stop and start as they always have before; get Washington to commit to buying a fixed volume of solar and wind power for government buildings and Army bases for 10 years, with only U.S.-based manufacturers able to compete for contracts; get Washington to set a new fleet average of 35 miles per gallon for Detroit within 10 years -- with no loopholes; establish government loan guarantees for any company that wants to build a nuclear power plant; and, finally, build a national transmission grid -- a green power superhighway -- so that solar energy from Arizona or wind from Wyoming can power homes in Chicago. Do all that and our private sector will take America from green laggard to green leader.Unfortunately, Congress is brewing instead a hodgepodge of incrementalism. This is particularly disappointing when America's corporate icons -- G.M., G.E., A.I.G., DuPont, PepsiCo -- ''have all come out in favor of a national mandatory limit on carbon emissions,'' notes Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense. ''But Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have not risen to their challenge.''We have a multigenerational problem that requires a systemic, multigenerational response, and that can happen only if we get our energy prices right. Only that will guarantee green innovation and commercialization at scale. Anything less is wasted breath and wasted money -- and any candidate who says otherwise is only contributing to global warming by adding hot air.Op-Ed ColumnistThe Middle East has gotten itself tied into such an impossible knot that Biblical references or Shakespearian quotations simply don't suffice anymore to describe how impossibly tangled politics has become here. Shira Wolosky, a Hebrew University English scholar, suggested to me that maybe Dr. Seuss, in ''The Cat in the Hat,'' offered the best way to sum up the Middle East today.Then he shut the Thingsin the box with the hook.And the cat went awayWith a sad kind of look.''That is good,'' said the fish.''He has gone away. Yes.but your mother will come.She will find this big mess!And this mess is so bigAnd so deep and so tall,we can not pick it up.There is no way at all!''Just look around. Gaza is turning into Mogadishu. Hamas is shelling Israel. Israel is retaliating. Iraq is a boiling pot. Iran is about to go nuclear. Lebanon is being pulled apart. Syria is being investigated for murdering Lebanon's prime minister. I could go on. Yes, this mess is so big and so tall. Who knows where to pick it up at all?In Israel, officials are mulling all alternatives -- from the Saudi peace initiative to negotiating with Hamas to opening talks with Syria to reoccupying Gaza to looking for a ''trustee'' for the West Bank -- because no one is sure anymore what to do.That is, the Left's way -- land for peace -- was discredited by the collapse of Oslo. The Right's way, permanent Israeli occupation of all ''The Land of Israel,'' was made impossible by Palestinian demographics and two uprisings. The third way, unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon and Gaza, has been discredited by Hezbollah's attack from Lebanon and the Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza.''Israel is in a place it has never been before,'' said Moshe Halbertal, a Hebrew University philosophy professor. ''It does not have a picture of where to go and how, so people are looking for a fourth way.''It is impossible to predict what that fourth way will be. But it is easy to identify the new realities it will have to take into account.First is the fact that Yasir Arafat's Fatah group, which has long dominated Palestinian life, is in disarray. Fatah will not disappear, but it will never again totally dominate the Palestinian Authority. Fatah will have to share power with Hamas, which has largely wiped out Fatah in Gaza already. Sooner or later, the U.S. and Israel are going to have to drop the economic sanctions they imposed on Palestinians to pressure Hamas into recognizing Israel. ''As repulsive as [Hamas] is to me as an Israeli, I don't think it's coming to the Palestinian Authority just to pay a visit -- it is here to stay,'' said Israeli TV's top Arab affairs reporter, Ehud Yaari.Israel's real choice is between dealing with a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority or watching it collapse into little pieces, which Israel would have to pick up. (Think Iraq and Somalia.) West Bank and Gaza unemployment is now around 40 percent. Talking with Palestinians in Ramallah, the phrase I heard most was not ''Israeli occupation'' but ''Palestinian disintegration.''Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki told me that as bad as things are today, his polls show most Palestinians still don't blame Hamas. They blame Israel and America for withholding funds from the Hamas government that Palestinians elected. The best way to diminish Hamas's influence, or to moderate it, is by forcing it to assume responsibility. Ask it: ''Do you want Palestinians to be able to work in Israel? Then sit down with Israel and work out the details.'' We need to ''force Hamas through a corridor of difficult decisions,'' said Israeli strategist Gidi Grinstein. If America can talk to Iran, Israel can talk to Hamas.Second, Hamas says it will only offer Israel a long-term cease-fire. Fine, take it. Fact No. 1: the real history of Israeli-Arab relations is: war, lull, war, lull, war, lull -- from 1948 until today. Fact No. 2: ''Since 1948,'' said Mr. Yaari, ''the Jews have always made better use of the lulls than the Arabs.'' Israel doesn't need Hamas's recognition. It needs a long lull.The third new reality is that Hamas's shelling of Israel from Gaza means Israel can never hand over the West Bank to the Palestinians, without an international trustee -- because from there Palestinians could close Israel's airport with one rocket. Only Jordan, or an international force, can be that trustee.Bottom line: I don't know if there is a fourth way, but, if there is, it will have to include these new realities. Otherwise, this mess will get even bigger, deeper and taller.Op-Ed ColumnistLucien Bronicki is one of Israel's foremost experts in geothermal power, but when I ran into him last week at Ben Gurion University, in Israel's Negev Desert, all he wanted to talk about was oil wells. Israel, he told me, had discovered oil.Pointing to a room full of young Israeli high-tech college seniors, Mr. Bronicki remarked: ''These are our oil wells.''It was quite a scene. Once a year Ben Gurion students in biomedical engineering, software, electrical engineering and computing create elaborate displays of their senior projects or -- as in the case of a student-made robot that sidled up to me -- demonstrate devices they've invented.On this occasion, Yossi Vardi, the godfather of Israeli venture capitalism -- ever since he backed the four young Israelis who invented the first Internetwide instant messaging system, Mirabilis, which was sold to AOL for $400 million in 1998 -- brought some of his venture capital pals, like Mr. Bronicki, down to Ben Gurion to scout out potential start-ups and to mentor the grads.The first student exhibit I visited was by Yuval Sharoni, 26, an electrical engineering senior, whose project was titled an ''Innovative Covariance Matrix for Point Target Detection in Hyperspectral Images'' (which has to do with military targeting). When I told him I was from The Times, he declared: ''This project is going to make the front page, I'm telling you.'' The cover of Popular Mechanics, maybe, but it could one day make the Nasdaq, where Israel now has the most companies listed of any nation outside of the United States.''Today, every Israeli Jewish mother wants her son to be a dropout and go create a start-up,'' said Mr. Vardi, who is currently invested in 38 different ones.Which gets to the point of this column: If you want to know why Israel's stock market and car sales are at record highs -- while Israel's government is paralyzed by scandals and war with Hamas and doesn't even have a finance minister -- it's because of this ecosystem of young innovators and venture capitalists. Last year, VCs poured about $1.4 billion into Israeli start-ups, which puts Israel in a league with India and China.Israel is Exhibit A of an economic phenomenon I see a lot these days. Of course, competition between countries and between companies still matters. But when the world becomes this flat -- with so many distributed tools of innovation and connectivity empowering individuals from anywhere to compete, connect and collaborate -- the most important competition is between you and your own imagination, because energetic, innovative and connected individuals can now act on their imaginations farther, faster, deeper and cheaper than ever before.Those countries and companies that empower their individuals to imagine and act quickly on their imagination are going to thrive. So while there are reasons to be pessimistic about Israel these days, there is one huge reason for optimism: this country has a culture that nurtures and rewards individual imagination -- one with no respect for limits or hierarchies, or fear of failure. It's a perfect fit with this era of globalization.''We are not investing in products or business plans today, but in people who have the ability to imagine and connect dots,'' said Nimrod Kozlovski, a top Israeli expert on Internet law who also works with start-ups. Israel is not good at building big companies, he explained, but it is very good at producing people who say, ''Wouldn't it be great if you could do this ,'' then create a start-up to do it -- which is later bought out and expanded by an Intel, Microsoft or Google.''The motto here is not work hard but dream hard,'' Mr. Kozlovski added. ''I had some guy come see me the other day and say, 'You know Google? They make a lot of money, very famous, right? They're not that good. We have a much better system that correlates to the cognitive process of searching. Google is worth $50 billion? Probably we can match their numbers.' He was dead serious.''My guess is that the flatter the world becomes, the wider the economic gap we will see between those countries that empower individual imagination and those that don't. High oil prices can temporarily disguise that gap, but it's growing.Iran's ignorant president, who keeps babbling about how Israel is going to disappear, ought to pay a visit to Ben Gurion and see these rooms buzzing with student innovators, with projects called ''Integration Points for IP Multimedia Subsystems'' and ''Algorithms for Obstacle Detection and Avoidance.'' These are oil wells that don't run dry.Op-Ed ColumnistI'm sitting in Ramallah at The Yasir Arafat Foundation listening to Nasser al-Kidwa, the thoughtful former Palestinian foreign minister, talk about Palestinian society ''disintegrating'' around him. What pains him most, he explains, is that any of his neighbors today with money, skills or a foreign passport are fleeing for the West or the Gulf. As he speaks, an old saying pops into my mind -- one that applies today to Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine: ''Would the last one out please turn off the lights.''The other day I wrote about how Israel was looking for a ''Fourth Way'' -- after the collapse of the Israeli Left's land-for-peace strategy, the Right's permanent occupation strategy and the Israeli third way's unilateral withdrawal strategy. Well, the Arab world also needs a Fourth Way.The Arabs tried Nasserism, i.e. authoritarian-nationalism, and that didn't work. It tried various brands of Arab socialism, and that didn't work. It even took a flier with bin Ladenism. Bin Laden was the thumb that many Arabs stuck in the eye of the West and of their own hated regimes. But, I would argue, bin Ladenism, and its various jihadist offshoots, has died in Iraq. Yes, it will still have adherents, but it has lost its revolutionary shine, because it has turned out to be nothing more than a death cult.In my book, the day it died was May 24, 2007, in Falluja, Iraq. Why? Because on that day, 27 people were killed when a suicide bomber in a car attacked a funeral procession for Allawi al-Isawi, a local contractor, who was killed earlier in the day. According to Reuters, ''as mourners walked down a main street holding aloft al-Isawi's coffin, the bomber drove into the crowd and blew himself up.''Think about that. No -- really think about it: A Muslim suicide bomber blew up a Muslim funeral. Is there anything lower? But that is what bin Laden and the jihadists have become: utter nihilists, responsible for killing more Muslims than anyone in the world today and totally uninterested in governing, only in making life ungovernable.But who offers a way forward? Right now the best Arabs can hope for are the decent, modernizing monarchies, like Jordan, Qatar, Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. I do not see any secular progressivism -- a Fourth Way -- emerging in the big Arab states like Egypt, Syria, Algeria and Iraq, that is, a progressivism that would effectively promote more rule of law, global integration, multiparty elections, women's empowerment and modern education to lay the foundations of decent governance. Far from it, Egypt had an election in 2005, and Ayman Nour, the candidate who dared to run against President Mubarak, got thrown in jail on phony charges.I also don't see a religious Fourth Way emerging -- a progressive Islam articulated by the big, popular Islamic parties like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood. Hezbollah took seats in the Lebanese cabinet and then proceeded to launch its own war with Israel. What a great vision.''Sadly,'' observed Middle East analyst Fawaz A. Gerges, in a recent essay on YaleGlobal Online, ''mainstream Islamists have provided neither vision nor initiative to build a broad alliance of social forces and transform the political space. They arm themselves with vacuous slogans like 'Islam is the solution.' '' No wonder, he adds, that the average Arab citizen is fed up today with both their rulers and the opposition, ''who promised heaven and delivered dust.''But since the Islamic parties have monopolized the mosques and the authoritarian regimes have monopolized the public square, anyone trying to articulate an Arab Fourth Way today ''is competing against either God or the state -- and between God and the state, what room is left for secular democrats?'' asked Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki.Only weeds can grow there -- small nihilist weeds, like Fatah al Islam in Lebanon or Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia in Iraq or Islamic Jihad in Gaza. And they are growing.''Now any five guys who want to work together and believe they can uphold God's name and have guns can start an army,'' said Mr. Kidwa. ''Money is all over the place. There is no money for the needed things, but there is a lot of money to finance [armed] groups.''That's why decent people, particularly Arab college grads, are leaving the area. They have no one to cheer for. The only hope for getting them back or for getting us out of Iraq -- without leaving the region to the most nihilistic or impoverished elements -- is an Arab Fourth Way. But it has to come from them -- and right now, it is not happening, not inside Iraq, not outside.Op-Ed ColumnistTwo weeks ago I took part in commencement for this year's doctoral candidates at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The ceremony was held in the amphitheater on Mount Scopus, which faces out onto the Dead Sea and the Mountains of Moab. The setting sun framed the graduate students in a reddish-orange glow against a spectacular biblical backdrop.Before I describe the ceremony, though, I have to note that it coincided with the news that Britain's University and College Union had called on its members to consider a boycott of Israeli universities, accusing them of being complicit in Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.Anyway, as the Hebrew U. doctoral candidates each had their names called out and rose to receive their diplomas from the university's leadership, I followed along in the program. The Israeli names rolled by: ''Moshe Nahmany, Irit Nowik, Yuval Ofir. But then every so often I heard an Arab name, like Nuha Hijazi or Rifat Azam or Taleb Mokari.Since the program listed everyone's degrees and advisers, I looked them up. Rifat got his doctorate in law. His thesis was about ''International Taxation of Electronic Commerce.'' His adviser was ''Prof. D. Gliksberg.'' Nuha got her doctorate in biochemistry. Her adviser was ''Prof. R. Gabizon.'' Taleb had an asterisk by his name. So I looked at the bottom of the page. It said: ''Summa Cum Laude.'' His chemistry thesis was about ''Semiconductor-Metal Interfaces,'' and his adviser was ''Prof. U. Banin.''These were Israeli Arab doctoral students -- many of them women and one of whom accepted her degree wearing a tight veil over her head. Funny -- she could receive her degree wearing a veil from the Hebrew University, but could not do so in France, where the veil is banned in public schools. Arab families cheered unabashedly when their sons and daughters received their Hebrew U. Ph.D. diplomas, just like the Jewish parents.How crazy is this, I thought. Israel's premier university is giving Ph.D.'s to Arab students, two of whom were from East Jerusalem -- i.e. the occupied territories -- supervised by Jewish Israeli professors, all while some far-left British academics are calling for a boycott of Israeli universities.I tell this story to underscore the obvious : that the reality here is so much more morally complex than the outside meddlers present it. Have no doubt, I have long opposed Israel's post-1967 settlements. They have squandered billions and degraded the Israeli Army by making it an army of occupation to protect the settlers and their roads. And that web of settlements and roads has carved up the West Bank in an ugly and brutal manner -- much uglier than Israel's friends abroad ever admit. Indeed, their silence, particularly American Jewish leaders, enabled the settlement lunacy.But you'd have to be a blind, deaf and dumb visitor to Israel today not to see that the vast majority of Israelis recognize this historic mistake, and they not only approved Ariel Sharon's unilateral uprooting of Israeli settlements in Gaza to help remedy it, but elected Ehud Olmert precisely to do the same in the West Bank. The fact that it is not happening now is hardly Israel's fault alone. The Palestinians are in turmoil.So to single out Israeli universities alone for a punitive boycott is rank anti-Semitism. Let's see, Syria is being investigated by the United Nations for murdering Lebanon's former prime minister, Rafik Hariri. Syrian agents are suspected of killing the finest freedom-loving Lebanese journalists, Gibran Tueni and Samir Kassir. But none of that moves the far left to call for a boycott of Syrian universities. Why? Sudan is engaged in genocide in Darfur. Why no boycott of Sudan? Why?If the far-left academics driving this boycott actually cared about Palestinians they would call on every British university to accept 20 Palestinian students on full scholarships to help them with what they need most -- building the skills to run a modern state and economy. And they would call on every British university to dispatch visiting professors to every Palestinian university to help upgrade their academic offerings. And they would challenge every Israeli university that already offers Ph.D.'s to Israeli Arabs to do even more. And they would challenge every Arab university the same way.That's what people who actually care about Palestinians would do. But just singling out Israeli universities for a boycott, in the face of all the other madness in the Middle East -- that's what anti-Semites would do.Op-Ed Columnist
