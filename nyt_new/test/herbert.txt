I've heard the concern expressed dozens of times by New Orleans residents who are poor and black and still living in enforced exile from their wounded city: Maybe they don't want us back.You hear it again and again and again, the tone of voice varying from sadness to anger to resignation, but always laced with the unmistakable pain of feeling unwelcome in one's own home. I've come to think of it as the New Orleans lament.''They are not trying to bring us home,'' said Geraldine Craig, who is living in a federally sponsored trailer encampment in Baton Rouge. ''Just the opposite. They're telling us to find housing here.''''It hurts,'' said Mimi Adams, a woman who wore out her welcome with relatives in Houston and Atlanta but has no idea when she might return to New Orleans. ''Even if I could find a place, the rents are too high,'' she said. ''They've gone up a lot. I'm told they don't want us poor folks back, that they're making it a city for the well-to-do. That's what I'm hearing.''Sixteen months have passed since the apocalyptic flood that followed Hurricane Katrina. More than 13,000 residents who were displaced by the storm are still living in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another 100,000 to 200,000 evacuees -- most of whom want to return home -- are scattered throughout the United States.The undeniable neglect of this population fuels the suspicion among the poor and the black, who constitute a majority of the evacuees, that the city is being handed over to the well-to-do and the white.If you talk to public officials, you will hear about billions of dollars in aid being funneled through this program or that. The maze of bureaucratic initiatives is dizzying. But when you talk to the people most in need of help -- the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the children -- you will find in most cases that the help is not reaching them. There is no massive effort, no master plan, to bring back the people who were driven from the city and left destitute by Katrina.Only the federal government could finance such an effort. Neither the city of New Orleans nor the state of Louisiana has anywhere near the kind of money that would be required. ''You've got a lot of people who don't have a place to stay,'' Gov. Kathleen Blanco told me in an interview on Friday, ''and they're spread all over creation.''The federal government has not come close to meeting the challenge of this overwhelming humanitarian crisis. Instead of a concerted, creative effort to develop housing and organize the return to New Orleans of the poor and working-class families who were the heart and soul of the city, the government focused to a large extent on rolling out travel trailers to temporarily house an embarrassingly small percentage of the people in need.''FEMA spent a lot on trailers,'' said Governor Blanco, ''trailers that are falling apart right now. And they spent as much money on those trailers in many cases as you would on putting a new house in place.''The simple fact is that no one at any level of government, city, state or federal, has shown the leadership that was needed in response to this astounding tragedy. I tried to talk about this last week with the mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, but he and his chief press aide were on vacation.The most candid official I spoke with was Raymond Jetson, the chief executive of the Louisiana Family Recovery Corps, an independent, nonprofit group set up by the state in the wake of the storm.''The most daunting aspect of the recovery is the human recovery,'' he said, ''and at this point it has certainly not received the resources or the attention that it needs.''What was readily apparent in the aftermath of the botched rescue was the damage to the levees, the ruined homes and the city's devastated infrastructure. ''I don't think,'' said Mr. Jetson, ''that the reality of what was happening in the lives of people and families was as apparent.''The situation remains desperate for thousands of displaced residents. ''Working families are finding it difficult to re-establish their households,'' Mr. Jetson said. ''People who are out of state want to come back home. The clock is ticking on the people who are living in the FEMA trailer communities. You have some people who are totally isolated from resources. And the emotional well-being of a significant number of people and families is literally in peril.''This is how the new year is starting out for the victims of the great flood of 2005.Op-Ed ColumnistHow long can this go on?Saddam is dead. The weapons of mass destruction were a mirage. More than 3,000 American G.I.s and scores of thousands of Iraqis have been killed. Voters in the United States have made it clear that they no longer support American involvement in this exercise in sustained barbarism. Incredibly, the U.S. military itself is turning against the war.And yet the president, against the counsel of his commanders on the ground, apparently is ready to escalate -- to send more American lives into the fire he set in Iraq.In a devastating critique of the war, the newsweekly Army Times led its current edition with the headline: ''About-Face on the War -- After 3 years of support, troops sour on Iraq.'' The article detailed a Military Times Poll that found, for the first time, that ''more troops disapprove of the president's handling of the war than approve of it.''Only a third of the service members surveyed approved of the president's conduct of the war, while 42 percent disapproved. Perhaps worse was the finding that only half of the troops believed that success in Iraq was likely.The service members made it clear that they were not attacking their commander in chief personally. His overall approval rating remained high. What has turned them off has been the wretched reality of the war. In the article, David Segal, director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland, said, ''They're seeing more casualties and fatalities and less progress.''In other words, they're seeing the same thing everybody else is seeing -- except, perhaps, Mr. Bush.On New Year's Day, readers of The New York Times could see the excruciating photo layout of the latest 1,000 American service members to die in Iraq. As in all wars, most of them were young. Many of them were smiling in the photos. All of them died unnecessarily.The war has been an exercise in futility and mind-boggling incompetence, and yet our involvement continues -- with no end in sight, no plans for withdrawal, no idea of where we might be headed -- as if the U.S. had fallen into some kind of bizarrely destructive trance from which it is unable to awaken.And who is paying the price for this insanity -- apart from ordinary Iraqis, who are paying the most grievous price of all? The burden of the war in the U.S. is being shouldered overwhelmingly by a contingent of Americans whom no one would categorize as economically privileged.As Lizette Alvarez and Andrew Lehren wrote in Monday's Times:''The service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile. They were mostly white men from rural areas, soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades. Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time. Some were going on their fourth, fifth or sixth deployment.''There is no way that this can be justified. It is just wrong.I've said many times that if a war is worth fighting the way to do it is to mobilize the entire country, drawing the warriors from as wide a swath of the population as possible and raising taxes on everyone as part of an all-out effort to defeat a common enemy.This war is not worth fighting. And if there were ever serious talk about enacting a draft or raising taxes to fight it, you'd see quickly enough that the vast majority of Americans would not find it worth fighting.There must be a leader somewhere who can shake the U.S. out of this tragic hypnotic state, who can see that it is beyond crazy to continue our involvement in this war indefinitely, to sacrifice another 1,000 young lives, and then another thousand after that.All of the tortured, twisted rationales for this war -- all of the fatuous intellectual pyrotechnics dreamed up to justify it -- have vaporized, and we're left with just the mad, mindless, meaningless and apparently endless slaughter.Shakespeare, in ''Henry VI,'' said: ''Now thou art come unto a feast of death.''We should end our participation in the feast of death in Iraq. It is criminal to continue feeding our troops into the slaughter.If there were politicians here at home with some of the courage of the troops in the field, we could begin saving lives rather than watching helplessly as the Bush White House continues to sacrifice them. Three thousand and counting is enough.Op-Ed ColumnistRobert L. Nardelli, the chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, began the new year with a pink slip and a golden parachute. The company handed him a breathtaking $210 million to take a hike. What would he have been worth if he'd done a good job?Data recently compiled by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston offers a startling look at just how out of whack executive compensation has become. Some of the Wall Street Christmas bonuses last month were fabulous enough to resurrect an adult's belief in Santa Claus. Morgan Stanley's John Mack got stock and options worth in excess of $40 million. Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs did even better -- $53.4 million.According to the center's director, Andrew Sum, the top five Wall Street firms (Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley) were expected to award an estimated $36 billion to $44 billion worth of bonuses to their 173,000 employees, an average of between $208,000 and $254,000, ''with the bulk of the gains accruing to the top 1,000 or so highest-paid managers.''Now consider what's been happening to the bulk of the American population, the ordinary men and women who have to work for a living somewhere below the stratosphere of the top corporate executives. Between 2000 and 2006, labor productivity in the nonfarm sector of the economy rose by an impressive 18 percent. But workers were not paid for that impressive effort. During that period, according to Mr. Sum, the inflation-adjusted weekly wages of workers increased by just 1 percent.That's $3.20 a week. As Mr. Sum wryly observed, that won't even buy you a six-pack of Bud Light. Joe Six-Pack has been downsized. Three bucks ain't what it used to be.There are 93 million production and nonsupervisory workers (exclusive of farmworkers) in the U.S. Their combined real annual earnings from 2000 to 2006 rose by $15.4 billion, which is less than half of the combined bonuses awarded by the five Wall Street firms for just one year.''Just these bonuses -- for one year -- overwhelmingly exceed all the pay increases received by these workers over the entire six-year period,'' said Mr. Sum.In a development described by Mr. Sum as ''quite stark and rather bleak for the economic well-being of the average worker,'' the once strong link between productivity gains and real wage increases has been severed. The mystery to me is why workers aren't more scandalized. If your productivity increases by 18 percent and your pay goes up by 1 percent, you've been dealt a hand full of jokers in a game in which jokers aren't wild.Workers have received some modest increases in benefits over the past six years, but most of the money from their productivity gains -- by far, it's not even a close call -- has gone into profits and the salaries of top executives.Fairness plays no role in this system. The corporate elite control it, and they have turned it to their ends.Mr. Sum, a longtime expert on the economic life of the American worker, said he is astonished at the degree to which ordinary workers have been shortchanged over the past several years. ''Productivity has been exceptional,'' he said. ''And for most of my life, the way to get wages up was to be more productive. That's how our economy was supposed to work.''The productivity gains in the go-go decades that followed World War II were broadly shared, and the result was a dramatic, sustained increase in the quality of life for most Americans. Nowadays workers have to be more productive just to maintain their economic status quo. Productivity gains are no longer broadly shared. They're barely shared at all.The pervasive unfairness in the way the great wealth of the United States is distributed should be seen for what it is, an insidious disease eating away at the structure of the society and undermining its future. The middle class is hurting, propped up by the wobbly crutches of personal debt. The safety net, not just for the poor, but for the middle class as well, is disappearing. The savings rate has dropped to below zero, and more Americans are filing for bankruptcy than for divorce.Your pension? Don't ask.There's a reason why the power elite get bent out of shape at the merest mention of a class conflict in the U.S. The fear is that the cringing majority that has taken it on the chin for so long will wise up and begin to fight back.Op-Ed ColumnistAs its problems mount, the Big Easy is becoming increasingly unnerved.Local officials, who will never be mistaken for the brightest lights in the firmament, have been unable to stem a hideous wave of murders. On Tuesday Mayor C. Ray Nagin said, ''Enough is enough,'' then added, ''But we've said that before.''The public school system, one of the worst in the nation, is trying to sell off some of its buildings to help with a desperate cash crunch.Most depressing, more than 17 months after the horror of Hurricane Katrina, mile after mile after mile of the city that loved to present itself as the epicenter of laughter and good times still lies in ruin.New Orleans is a place that could use a hopeful sign of any kind, some positive development to signal that perhaps better times are coming.Enter Ghebre Selassie Mehreteab. Most people call him Gabe, and so will I for the rest of this column. Gabe is a middle-aged bundle of energy who heads the NHP Foundation, a national nonprofit organization that has taken on the difficult mission of providing quality housing at rents that poor and middle-class families can afford. There is no more imperative need in New Orleans than affordable housing.On Garden Oaks Drive in the Algiers neighborhood Gabe showed me a remarkable sight -- a sparkling two-story apartment complex, neatly landscaped, that was owned by NHPF, was badly damaged by the hurricane, and is now being completely renovated at a cost of $20 million.Nearby are buildings that look like the hurricane hit them yesterday. The NHPF complex, known as Forest Park, will have 284 solid, attractive, energy-efficient units completed this year, with tenants beginning to move in as early as May. The rents will range from $194 to $673 a month.In New Orleans East, which had been completely submerged in the flood, I stood with Gabe and an architect at what was once the site of a housing complex known as Walnut Square. ''New Orleans East was under water for eight days,'' said Gabe. ''We had to raze it. It's demolished.''A quiet wind was blowing across the vast empty space where 18 residential buildings used to be.The effort to rebuild Walnut Square, at a cost of $37 million, is already under way. There will be 209 apartments, with rents ranging from $130 to $820 a month. There will also be a commercial strip, a community center and day care facilities. (The apartments will be built on raised foundations to guard against future catastrophic floods.)Eventually Gabe hopes to build 3,000 affordable rental apartments in and around New Orleans at a total cost of $300 million.How does he do it, when others find the task so daunting?The key, he said, is to combine the expertise of a successful real estate operation with the talent and vision of an experienced foundation committed to what is essentially a charitable mission. NHPF, which has its Louisiana office in Baton Rouge, gets the funds to build from government grants, tax credits and low-interest loans, as well as conventional financing.As Gabe dryly noted, ''There is not much profit in developing low-income housing.''No successful rebirth of New Orleans is possible without substantial amounts of new and rebuilt housing -- housing that the city's very large percentage of low-income residents can afford. Most of the people homing in on development opportunities here have either no interest or no expertise in building such housing.''There are essentially two kinds of organizations here,'' said Gabe. ''You have out-of-town real estate developers who look at this as a tremendous opportunity and their main concern, quite naturally, has been how much money they can make. On the other hand, you have well-meaning nonprofit entities that unfortunately, in most cases, do not have the capacity to develop on a significant scale.''Compounding the problem has been the lack of housing expertise in New Orleans. Much of the city's housing stock pre-Katrina was so poor as to be illegal in most major American cities. The Housing Authority of New Orleans, which administered public housing, was in such bad shape its operations had to be taken over by the federal government.Half the population of New Orleans has been dispersed across the United States. Many of those still in the city are living in trailers or are doubled up with relatives and friends. There is no way to overstate the desperate need for housing.Gabe and the NHP Foundation have provided at least one model that works.Op-Ed ColumnistI was surprised recently by a sudden shift in the tone of a veteran cabdriver, Stanley Taylor, who had been kind enough to take me on a nearly four-hour tour of the flood-wrecked regions of the city.For most of the afternoon, Mr. Taylor had been wonderfully informative and polite, and his comments had been filled with sympathy for those who had lost so much to Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath.But as we headed back to my hotel, and darkness began to fall over the eerily still neighborhoods, his tone became unmistakably bitter. We had been talking casually about the thousands of extremely poor evacuees, most of them black, who were still stranded outside New Orleans, some of them scattered to the far reaches of the United States.Mr. Taylor, who is black, snapped that maybe it would be better if some of them didn't come back. ''The poor people that's gone,'' he said, ''they're gonna have to stay gone. That's where all the crime was coming from, see? Folks here want people to come back, but they want people with money to come back. The criminals? Shame on 'em. Sorry for 'em.''During the immediate post-Katrina period, there were essentially two visions of a resurgent New Orleans. One, widely decried as racist, saw the new, improved New Orleans as smaller, whiter and more prosperous.This was openly advocated. Just a few days after the storm, a wealthy member of the city's power elite, James Reiss, told The Wall Street Journal: ''Those who want to see this city rebuilt want to see it done in a completely different way: demographically, geographically and politically.''Mr. Reiss, who is white and served in Mayor C. Ray Nagin's administration as chairman of the Regional Transit Authority (he has since left the government), said that he and many of his colleagues would leave town if New Orleans did not become a city with better services and fewer poor people.An alternative (and more widely desired) model of the city coincided with the approach that President Bush seemed to be taking when he made his dramatic appearance in floodlit Jackson Square in mid-September 2005. Mr. Bush promised not just to help rebuild New Orleans, but to confront the long-simmering problems of race and poverty with ''bold action.''Supporters of this approach envisioned an effort that would bring desperately needed assistance to the hurricane victims, helping to get them housed and back on their feet, while at the same time constructively engaging the contentious issues that have kept America's blacks and whites in a state of perpetual hostility, and much of the poor in an all-but-permanent morass of ignorance and deprivation.What is actually happening is worse than anyone had imagined.New Orleans is a mess. It was brought to its knees by Katrina, and is being kept there by a toxic combination of federal neglect and colossal, mind-numbing ineptitude at the local level.The police department here is a sour joke, and crime is out of control. More than 16 months after the storm, children roam the streets with impunity during school hours. Debris still covers much of the city. Doctors, hospitals and mental-health facilities are in woefully short supply. Thousands of residents are still living in trailers, and many thousands more are stuck more or less permanently out of town.The result is that blacks and whites, feeling unsafe physically and frightened by the long-term prospect of dwindling opportunities, are eyeing the exits.Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu, who lost the mayoral race last May to Mr. Nagin, offered a grim assessment. While the ethnic breakdown may remain roughly the same, he said, the city is on its way to becoming ''smaller, poorer and worse than it was before.''Class, at the moment, is trumping race, which is how Mr. Reiss and Mr. Taylor, the cabdriver, came unwittingly to similar stereotyped conclusions. Unless the foundations of a livable city can be put in place -- and they are not being put in place now -- those with the ability to leave will do so. The poor, neglected as always, will be left behind.''The same thing is moving African-Americans as is moving whites,'' Mr. Landrieu said. ''Everyone is asking: 'Is it safe? What's the school situation? Can my kids play outside? What does the future hold for them?' ''Without a creative new plan and energetic new leadership, New Orleans will be unable to save itself. Right now it's a city sinking to ever more tragic depths.Op-Ed ColumnistOn the evening of the fourth of April, 1967, one year to the day (almost to the hour) before his assassination, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. walked into Riverside Church in Manhattan and delivered a speech that was among his least well known, yet most controversial.''I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight,'' he said, ''because my conscience leaves me no other choice.''The speech was an eloquent, full-throated denunciation of the war in Vietnam, one of the earliest public critiques by such a high-profile American. Silence in the face of the horrors of that war, said Dr. King, amounted to a ''betrayal.''The speech unleashed a hurricane of criticism. Even the N.A.A.C.P. complained about Dr. King stepping out of his perceived area of expertise, civil rights, to raise his voice against the evil of the war. The Times headlined an editorial, ''Dr. King's Error.''The war would go on for another eight years, ultimately taking the lives of 58,000 Americans and a million to two million Vietnamese. Dr. King himself would be silenced, at the age of 39, by a bullet in Memphis.The widespread celebration of Dr. King's birthday on Monday brought that Vietnam speech to mind. It's both gratifying and important that we honor this great man with a national holiday. But it's disturbing that we pay so much more attention to the celebrations than we do to the absolutely crucial lessons that he spent much of his life trying to teach us.Whether it's the war in Iraq, or the plight of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, or the violence and self-destructive behavior that plagues so many black Americans, our attitude toward the wisdom of Dr. King has been that of the drug addict or alcoholic to the notion that there might be a better way. We give lip service to it, and then we ignore it.In the Vietnam speech, Dr. King said, ''A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.'' He may as well have been speaking into the void. The war in Iraq, a reprise of Vietnam, will cost us well over a trillion dollars before we're done, and probably more than two trillion. More than 3,000 American G.I.'s have been killed and the death toll for Iraqis is tallied by the scores of thousands.No one knows what to do, although the politicians and the pundits are all over television, day and night, background singers to the carnage.Here at home the city of New Orleans is on life support, struggling to survive the combined effects of a catastrophic flood, the unconscionable neglect of the federal government, and the monumental ineptitude of its own local officials. As ordinary residents of New Orleans continue to suffer, the rest of the nation has casually turned away. The debacle is no longer being televised. So it must be over.Dr. King held the unfashionable view that we had an obligation to help those who are in trouble, and to speak out against unfair treatment and social injustice. ''Our lives begin to end,'' he said, ''the day we become silent about things that matter.''New Orleans matters. And the long dark night of the war in Iraq must surely matter. But not enough voices of protest are being raised in either case. The anger quotient is much too low. You can't stop America's involvement in a senseless war or revive a dying American city if your greatest passion is kicking back with pizza and beer and tuning in to ''American Idol.''The quality of life for black Americans more than 38 years after the death of Dr. King is a mixed bag. Blacks are far better off economically and educationally than ever before. Barack Obama is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, and the last two secretaries of state have been black.But the ominous shadow of racial prejudice is still with us. Even President Bush acknowledged that conditions in New Orleans pre-Katrina were proof of that. The nation's prisons are filled to the bursting point with black men who have failed, or been failed, and have no viable future. And too many black Americans are willing and even eager to see themselves in the culturally depraved lineup of gangsters, pimps and whores.Dr. King would be 78 now, and I can't believe that he would be too thrilled by what's going on. In his view: ''He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.''We miss his leadership, all of us, whether we're wise enough to realize it or not.Op-Ed ColumnistAmericans are increasingly living in a house of cards -- credit cards.A disturbing new report shows that with health care costs continuing their sharp rise, low- and middle-income patients are reaching for their credit cards with alarming frequency to cover treatment that they otherwise would be unable to afford.This medical debt, to be paid off in many cases at sky-high interest rates, is being loaded onto consumer debt that is already at dangerously high levels. Many families have been crushed by the load, driven from their homes, forced into bankruptcy, and worse.The report, released last week, was jointly compiled by Demos, a public policy group in New York, and the Access Project, which is affiliated with a health policy institute at Brandeis University and is trying to broaden the availability of health care in the U.S.Imagine for a moment the seriously ill patient who needs to be hospitalized. In the cold new world of health care, the primary message to such patients is often ''Show me the money!''In many instances, of course, the patient does not have the money. What the report found is that even people with health insurance are being drained by health care costs to the point where the credit card seems the only option.''As deductibles and co-payments increase,'' the report said, ''hospitals are finding more patients unable to pay their medical bills. Some hospital management analysts are expecting an increase in self-pay patients and are bracing for higher levels of bad debt.''In recognition of the evolving payment landscape and the risk of hospital bad debt, health care providers are more aggressively seeking upfront collection of co-pays and deductibles. A component of this strategy is to encourage patients to use third-party lenders such as credit cards to pay for medical expenses they cannot afford, which families frequently do to meet high medical bills.''It's one thing to reach for your Visa or MasterCard to pay for a Barbie doll or flat-screen TV. It's way different to pull out the plastic because you've just learned you have cancer or heart disease, and you don't have any other way to pay for treatment that would prevent a premature trip to the great beyond.A society is seriously out of whack when legalized loan sharks are encouraged to close in on those who are broke and desperately ill.This medical indebtedness is hardly surprising. Health care costs continue to rise much faster than family income and inflation, and Americans (who have stopped saving altogether) were already mired in staggering amounts of personal debt. Some families have been putting their groceries on credit cards. Many have taken the financially disastrous step of using home equity loans to bring down credit card balances.A serious illness for people already in shaky economic circumstances can be the final push into bankruptcy.According to the report, called ''Borrowing to Stay Healthy,'' about 29 percent of low- and middle-income families with credit card debt reported using their credit cards to pay medical expenses -- in most cases for major medical problems.Over all, a full 20 percent of low- and middle-income families with credit card debt said they had used their cards to cover major medical expenses over the prior three years.This indebtedness -- subject to monthly late fees and penalties, and interest rates that can reach 30 percent -- only adds to the trauma of serious illness.It's believed that 29 million Americans are burdened with medical debt of one form or another. Individuals who are already saddled with medical bills that they can't pay are much more likely to avoid further medical treatment and to leave drug prescriptions unfilled. Such decisions often have life-threatening consequences.There is an epidemic of personal bankruptcies in the U.S. and medical factors are believed to play a role in as many as half of them.These are problems that cry out for reform -- of the American health care system and the American way of debt, both of which seriously threaten the American way of life. At the very least, in the short term, we need to protect financially vulnerable patients from a credit card universe in which there are no legal limits on fees or interest, and where the abuse of customers is the norm.Op-Ed ColumnistPresident Bush showed what he does well at the beginning of the State of the Union ceremony when he graciously acknowledged and introduced Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House of Representatives. He seemed both generous and sincere, and it was the right touch for a genuinely historic moment.At the end of his speech he introduced four Americans of whom the nation can be proud, including Wesley Autrey, a New Yorker who made like a Hollywood stunt man to save the life of a stricken passenger who had fallen onto the tracks in front of an oncoming subway train.The rest of the evening was a study in governmental dysfunction. The audience kept mindlessly applauding -- up and down, like marionettes -- when in fact there was nothing to applaud. The state of the union is wretched, which is why the president's approval ratings are the worst since Nixon and Carter.If Mr. Bush is bothered by his fall from political grace, it wasn't showing on Tuesday night. He seemed as relaxed as ever, smiling, signing autographs, glad-handing.I wanted to hear him talk about the suffering of the soldiers he has put in harm's way, and the plight of the residents of New Orleans. I wanted to hear him express a little in the way of sorrow for the many thousands who have died unnecessarily on his watch. I wanted to see him slip the surly bonds of narcissism and at least acknowledge the human wreckage that is the sum and substance of his sustained folly.But this is a president who runs when empathy calls. While others are monitoring the casualty lists, he's off to the gym. At least Lyndon Johnson had the decency to agonize over the losses he unleashed in Vietnam.The State of the Union speech was boilerplate at a time when much of the country, with good reason, is boiling mad. The United States, the most powerful nation in the history of the world, seems paralyzed. It can't extricate itself from the war in Iraq, can't rebuild the lost city of New Orleans, can't provide health care for all of its citizens, can't come up with a sane energy policy in the era of global warming, can't even develop a thriving public school system.If it's true, as President Bush told his audience, that ''much is asked of us,'' it's equally true that very little has been delivered.The Democrats, delighted by the wounded Bush presidency, believe this is their time. Like an ostentation of peacocks, an extraordinary crowd of excited candidates is gathering in hopes of succeeding Mr. Bush.But such a timid crowd!Ask a potential Democratic president what he or she would do about the war, and you'll get a doctoral dissertation about the importance of diplomacy, the possibility of a phased withdrawal (but not too quick), the need for Iraqis to help themselves and figure out a way to divvy up the oil, and so on and so forth.A straight answer? Surely you jest. The Democrats remind me of the boxer in the Bonnie Raitt lyric who was ''afraid to throw a punch that might land.''There's a hole in the American system where the leadership used to be. The country that led the miraculous rebuilding effort in the aftermath of World War II can't even build an adequate system of levees on its own Gulf Coast.The most effective answer to this leadership vacuum would be a new era of political activism by ordinary citizens. The biggest, most far-reaching changes of the past century -- the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the women's movement -- were not primarily the result of elective politics, but rather the hard work of committed citizen-activists fed up with the status quo.It's time for thoughtful citizens to turn off their TVs and step into the public arena. Protest. Attend meetings. Circulate petitions. Run for office. I suspect the public right now is way ahead of the politicians when it comes to ideas about creating a more peaceful, more equitable, more intelligent society.The candidates for the most part are listening to their handlers and gurus and fat-cat contributors, which is the antithesis of democracy. It's not easy for ordinary men and women to be heard above that self-serving din, but it can be done.Voters should listen to Dwight Eisenhower, who said in 1954:''Politics ought to be the part-time profession of every citizen who would protect the rights and privileges of free people and who would preserve what is good and fruitful in our national heritage.''Op-Ed ColumnistIt was a few minutes after 11 a.m. when the scattered crowd began moving slowly toward the stage at the end of the Mall. The sky was a beautiful sunlit blue and the Capitol building, huge and white and majestic, offered the protesters an emotional backdrop that seemed almost close enough to touch.''It's so big,'' said a woman from Milwaukee, who was there with her husband and two children. ''It's lovely. Makes you want to cry.''You can say what you want about the people opposed to this wretched war in Iraq, try to stereotype them any way you can. But you couldn't walk among them for more than a few minutes on Saturday without realizing that they love their country as much as anyone ever has. They love it enough to try to save it.By 11:15 I thought there was a chance that the march against the war would be a bust. There just weren't that many people moving toward the stage to join the rally that preceded the march. But the crowd kept building, slowly, steadily. It was a good-natured crowd. Everyone was bad-mouthing the Bush administration and the war, but everybody seemed to be smiling.There were gray-haired women with digital cameras and young girls with braces. There were guys trying to look cool in knit caps and shades and balding baby boomers trading stories about Vietnam. And many ordinary families.''Where's Hillary?'' someone asked.That evoked laughter in the crowd. ''She's in Iowa running for president,'' someone said.When a woman asked, ''What's her position on the war?'' a man standing next to her cracked, ''She was for it before she was against it.''More laughter.The crowd kept building. There were people being pushed in wheelchairs and babies in strollers. There were elderly men and women, walking very slowly in some cases and holding hands.The goal of the crowd was to get the attention of Congress and persuade it to move vigorously to reverse the Bush war policies. But the thought that kept returning as I watched the earnestly smiling faces, so many of them no longer young, was the way these protesters had somehow managed to keep the faith. They still believed, after all the years and all the lies, that they could make a difference. They still believed their government would listen to them and respond.''I have to believe in this,'' said Donna Norton of Petaluma, Calif. ''I have a daughter in the reserves and a son-in-law on active duty. I feel very, very strongly about this.''Betty and Peter Vinten-Johansen of East Lansing, Mich., said they felt obliged to march, believing that they could bolster the resolve of opponents of the war in Congress. Glancing toward the Capitol, Mr. Vinten-Johansen said, ''Maybe we can strengthen their backbone a little bit.''Even the celebrities who have been at this sort of thing for decades have managed to escape the debilitating embrace of cynicism. ''How can you be cynical?'' asked Tim Robbins, just before he mounted the stage to address the crowd, which by that time had grown to more than 100,000.''This is inspiring,'' he said. ''It's the real voice of the American people, and when you hear that collective voice protesting freely it reminds you of the greatness of our country. It gives you hope.''When Jane Fonda said, ''Silence is no longer an option,'' she was doing more than expressing the outrage of the crowd over the carnage in Iraq and the president's decision to escalate American involvement. She was implicitly re-asserting her belief in the effectiveness of citizen action.Ms. Fonda is approaching 70 now and was at the march with her two grandchildren. It was very touching to watch her explain how she had declined to participate in antiwar marches for 34 years because she was afraid her notoriety would harm rather than help the effort.The public is way out in front of the politicians on this issue. But the importance of Saturday's march does not lie primarily in whether it hastens a turnaround of U.S. policy on the war. The fact that so many Americans were willing to travel from every region of the country to march against the war was a reaffirmation of the public's commitment to our peaceful democratic processes.It is in that unique and unflagging commitment, not in our terrifying military power, that the continued promise and greatness of America are to be found.Op-Ed ColumnistOn the afternoon of Oct. 7, 1974, a mob of 200 enraged whites, many of them students, closed in on a bus filled with black students that was trying to pull away from the local high school. The people in the mob were in a high-pitched frenzy. They screamed racial epithets and bombarded the bus with rocks and bottles. The students on the bus were terrified.When a shot was heard, the kids on the bus dived for cover. But it was a 13-year-old white boy standing near the bus, not far from his mother, who toppled to the ground with a bullet wound in his head. The boy, a freshman named Timothy Weber, died a few hours later.That single shot in this rural town about 25 miles up the Mississippi River from New Orleans set in motion a tale of appalling injustice that has lasted to the present day.Destrehan was in turmoil in 1974 over school integration. The Supreme Court's historic desegregation ruling was already 20 years old -- time enough, the courts said, for Destrehan and the surrounding area to comply. But the Ku Klux Klan was still welcome in Destrehan in those days, and David Duke, its one-time imperial wizard, was an admired figure. White families in the region wanted no part of integration.When black students were admitted to Destrehan High, they were greeted with taunts, various forms of humiliation and violence. Some of the black students fought back, and in the period leading up to the shooting there had been racial fights at a football game and inside the school.While the Weber boy was being taken to a hospital, authorities ordered the black students off the bus and searched each one. The bus was also thoroughly searched. No weapon was found, and there was no evidence to indicate that the shot had come from the bus. The bus driver insisted it had not come from the bus, but from someone firing at the bus.One of the black youngsters, a 16-year-old named Gary Tyler, was arrested for disturbing the peace after he talked back to a sheriff's deputy -- one of the few deputies in St. Charles Parish who was black. It may have been young Tyler's impudence that doomed him. He was branded on the spot as the designated killer.(Later, at a trial, the deputy, Nelson Coleman, was asked whose peace had been disturbed by Mr. Tyler's comments. ''Mine,'' he replied.)Matters moved amazingly fast after the shooting. Racial tension gave way to racial hysteria. A white boy had been killed and some black had to pay. Mr. Tyler, as good a black as any, was taken to a sheriff's substation where he was beaten unmercifully amid shouted commands that he confess. He would not.It didn't matter. In just a little over a year he would be tried, convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death by electrocution.The efficiency of the process was chilling. Evidence began to miraculously appear. Investigators ''found'' a .45-caliber pistol. Never mind that there were no fingerprints on it and it turned out to have been stolen from a firing range used by the sheriff's deputies. (Or that it subsequently disappeared as conveniently as it was found.) The authorities said they found the gun on the bus, despite the fact that the initial search had turned up nothing.The authorities found witnesses who said that Mr. Tyler had been the gunman. Never mind that the main witness, a former girlfriend of Mr. Tyler's, was a troubled youngster who had been under the care of a psychiatrist and had a history of reporting phony crimes to the police, including a false report of a kidnapping. She and every other witness who fingered Mr. Tyler would later recant, charging that they had been terrorized into testifying falsely by the police.A sworn affidavit from Larry Dabney, who was seated by Mr. Tyler on the bus, was typical. He said his treatment by the police was the ''scariest thing'' he'd ever experienced. ''They didn't even ask me what I saw,'' he said. ''They told me flat out that I was going to be their key witness.  They told me I was going to testify that I saw Gary with a gun right after I heard the shot and that a few minutes later I had seen him hide it in a slit in the seat. That was not true. I didn't see Gary or anybody else in that bus with a gun.''Mr. Tyler was spared electrocution when the Supreme Court declared Louisiana's death penalty unconstitutional. But in many ways he has in fact paid with his life. He'll turn 50 this year in the state penitentiary at Angola, where he is serving out his sentence of life without parole for the murder of Timothy Weber.Op-Ed ColumnistThe term ''time warp'' could have been coined for this rural town of 11,000 residents that sits beside, and just a little below, the Mississippi River. A remnant of the sugar-plantation era, the region's racially troubled past is always here, seldom spoken about but inescapable, like the murk in the air of a perpetually stalled weather front.The Harry Hurst Middle School is on the site of the old Destrehan High School, which was the scene of violent protests during the integration period of the 1970s. Local residents have tried to blot out the murder case that made Destrehan High notorious three decades ago, but there's a big problem with that collective effort to forget. The black teenager who was railroaded into prison (and almost into the electric chair) for the murder of a white student in 1974 is still in prison all these many years later. He's middle-aged now, still suffering through a life sentence without any chance for parole in the notorious state penitentiary at Angola.There is no longer any doubt that the case against the teenager, Gary Tyler, was a travesty. A federal appeals court ruled unequivocally that he did not receive a fair trial. The Louisiana Board of Pardons issued rulings on three occasions that would have allowed Mr. Tyler to be freed.But this is the South and Mr. Tyler was a black person convicted of killing a white. It didn't matter that the case was built on bogus evidence and coerced witnesses, or that the trial was, in the words of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, ''fundamentally unfair.'' Mr. Tyler was never given a new trial and the pardon board recommendations were rejected by two governors.(Lurking in the background as the case unfolded was David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who was very active politically in Louisiana and always ready to inject his poison into the public issues of the day. If you drive around Destrehan and nearby communities today you will still see some of the old blue-and-white campaign signs for Duke.)Mr. Tyler, a sophomore at Destrehan High, was on a bus filled with black students that was attacked on Oct. 7, 1974, by a white mob enraged over school integration. A shot was fired and a 13-year-old white boy standing outside the bus collapsed, mortally wounded. Mr. Tyler was arrested on a charge of disturbing the peace after he talked back to a sheriff's deputy.Although the bus and its passengers were searched and no weapon was found, Mr. Tyler was taken into custody, savagely beaten and accused of committing the murder. A gun was ''found'' during a subsequent search of the bus and witnesses were rounded up to testify against Mr. Tyler. It turned out that the gun (which has since disappeared) had been stolen from a firing range used by officers of the sheriff's department. All of the witnesses who fingered Mr. Tyler would eventually recant, saying they had been terrorized into testifying falsely by the authorities.Mr. Tyler was represented at trial by a white sole practitioner who had never handled a murder case, much less a death penalty case. He kept his meetings with his client to a minimum and would later complain about the money he was paid.The outcome was predictable. Mr. Tyler was convicted and sentenced to die in the electric chair by an all-white jury. At 17, he was the youngest prisoner on death row in the country. He almost certainly would have been executed if the U.S. Supreme Court had not ruled the Louisiana death penalty unconstitutional.The Fifth Circuit ruling in 1981 said that an improper charge to the jury had denied Mr. Tyler the presumption of innocence at his trial. ''It is folly,'' the court said, ''to argue that the erroneous charge did not affect the central determination of guilt or innocence.''What was folly was any expectation that Mr. Tyler would be treated fairly at any point. Despite the appeals court ruling, he was denied a new trial on a technicality.Now consider this, because it will tell you all you need to know about racial justice in the South. A 19-year-old black man named Richard Dunn was shotgunned to death as he was heading home from a benefit dance in support of Mr. Tyler at Southern University in New Orleans in 1976. A white man, Anthony Mart, was arrested and convicted of shooting Mr. Dunn from a passing car.Gary Tyler's current attorney, Mary Howell, ruefully explained what happened to Mr. Mart for the cold-blooded killing of a black stranger: He was sent to prison for life but was pardoned and freed after serving about 10 years.Op-Ed ColumnistJuanita Tyler lives in a neat one-story house that sits behind a glistening magnolia tree that dominates the small front lawn.She is 74 now and unfailingly gracious, but she admits to being tired from a lifetime of hard work and trouble. I went to see her to talk about her son, Gary.The Tylers are black. In 1974, when Gary was 16, he was accused of murdering a 13-year-old white boy outside the high school that they attended in nearby Destrehan. The boy was shot to death in the midst of turmoil over school integration, which the local whites were resisting violently.The case against young Tyler -- who was on a bus with other black students that was attacked by about 200 whites -- was built on bogus evidence and coerced testimony. But that was enough to get him convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to die in the electric chair. His life was spared when the Louisiana death penalty was ruled unconstitutional, but he is serving out a life sentence with no chance of parole in the state penitentiary at Angola.Ms. Tyler's sharpest memory of the day Gary was arrested was of sitting in a room at a sheriff's station, listening to deputies in the next room savagely beating her son.''They beat Gary so bad,'' she said. ''My poor child. I couldn't do nothing. They wouldn't let me in there. I saw who went in there. They were like older men. They didn't care that I was there. They didn't care who was there. They beat Gary something awful, and I could hear him hollering and moaning. All I could say was, 'Oh Jesus, have mercy.'''One of the deputies had a strap and they whipped him with that. It was terrible. Finally, when they let me go in there, Gary was just trembling. He was frightened to death. He was trembling and rocking back and forth. They had kicked him all in his privates. He said, 'Mama, they kicked me. One kicked me in the front and one kicked in the back.' He said that over and over.''I couldn't believe what they had done to my baby.''The deputies had tried to get Gary to confess, but he wouldn't. Ms. Tyler (like so many people who have looked closely at this case) was scornful of the evidence the authorities came up with.''It was ridiculous,'' she said. ''Where was he gonna get that big ol' police gun they said he used? It was a great big ol' gun. And he had on those tight-fitting clothes and nobody saw it?''The gun that investigators produced as the murder weapon was indeed a large, heavy weapon -- a government-issued Colt .45 that had been stolen from a firing range used by the sheriff's department. Deputies who saw Gary before the shooting and those who searched him (and the rest of the black students on the bus) immediately afterward did not see any gun.''I don't know where the police got that gun from,'' said Ms. Tyler. ''But they didn't get it from my son, that's for sure.''Ms. Tyler worked for many years as a domestic while raising 11 children. Her husband, Uylos, a maintenance worker who often held three jobs at a time, died in 1989. ''He had a bad heart,'' Ms. Tyler said.She shifted in her chair in the living room of the small house, and was quiet for several minutes. Then she asked, ''Do you know what it's like to lose a child?''I shook my head.''I always felt sorry for that woman whose son was killed,'' she said. ''That was a terrible time. I remember it clear, like it was yesterday. But what happened was wrong. The white people, they didn't want no black children in that school. So there was a lot of tension. And my son has paid a terrible price for that.''They didn't have no kind of proof against him, but they beat him bad anyway, and then they sentenced him to the electric chair.''Ms. Tyler visits Gary at Angola regularly, the last time a few weeks ago. ''He's doing well,'' she said. ''And I'm glad that he's able to cope. He tries to help the young ones out when they come in there. He always tells me, 'My dear, you have to stay strong so I can stay strong.' So then I just try to hold my head up and keep on going.''She looked for a moment as if she was going to cry, but she didn't.''It's just sad,'' she said. ''I wonder if he'll ever be able to come out. I wonder will I live long enough to see him out.''Op-Ed ColumnistAlmost all the talk about the 2008 presidential election is about the horse race: Who's up? Who's down? Can Hillary hold her lead? Can a pro-choice, pro-gay-rights candidate like Rudy Giuliani outrun a hawkish maverick like John McCain?It's a sport. It's fun. Why spoil it by being too serious?Senator Barack Obama, in his speech in Illinois Saturday formally launching his presidential bid, gave us an excellent reason for being serious:Ladies and gentlemen, there's a war on.After going through a litany of lofty goals for a new generation to strive for, including health care for all Americans, a rejuvenated public education system, an end to poverty and real progress in dealing with global warming, the senator offered a hard and simple truth:''All of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.''The war -- which, in addition to its human toll, will ultimately cost $2 trillion or more -- has put America in a straitjacket, precluding progress on a range of important issues that will only worsen with continued neglect.The public seems to understand this. It was voters fed up with the war who snatched control of both houses of Congress from the Republicans in last November's elections. And they were the ones giving Senator Hillary Clinton a hard time in New Hampshire over the weekend.While Senator Obama is pushing a plan to bring American combat troops home by March 2008 (and former Senator John Edwards is calling for an immediate withdrawal), Senator Clinton continues to dance on the war issue. ''I know that there is a great deal of frustration and anger and outrage,'' she said on Saturday, ''but we can't just wave a magic wand and make things change.''We've moved beyond the absurd when it comes to the war. President Bush responded to the antiwar sentiment in last November's election by escalating U.S. involvement in Iraq. Vice President Dick Cheney, lost in a zone of unreality, is blithely spreading the fantasy of ''enormous progress.'' He may not have noticed that the last three months have been among the worst of the war.The Democrats who benefited from the antiwar vote reacted to the president's thumb in the eye of the voters with their usual timidity. They've put their hearts and souls into a marathon effort to pass a nonbinding  resolution opposing the troop surge. Be still my heart.The bottom line is that nothing has changed. The horror stories continue to spew out of Iraq: the helicopters being shot down, the mass killings in marketplaces, the steady stream of U.S. soldiers returning in body bags.We need to stop pretending that there is something sane about continued U.S. involvement in this ruinous war. We keep sending troops into the combat zone and they keep sinking ever deeper into the ancient Middle East sand. To keep sending young people off to die in a war that everybody knows is pointless is criminal.On NBC's ''Nightly News'' last Friday the correspondent Richard Engel, traveling with a convoy of soldiers from the First Infantry Division, had a close call when a roadside bomb detonated several feet away. No one was hurt, and Staff Sgt. Chris Copley said into the camera, with a laugh and a hint of bravado, ''It gets the adrenaline going a little bit, doesn't it?''But Mr. Engel noted that when the convoy returned to its patrol base, Sergeant Copley and other soldiers were openly wondering, ''What are they doing out here?''It's a question that deserves a clear, straight answer, especially from their commander in chief and the politicians running for president. As the casualties mount and success seems more and more unlikely, a sense of resignation is spreading among U.S. troops.Sergeant Copley told Mr. Engel: ''It's pretty much almost a lost cause. Nothing it seems that we do is doing any good.''Mr. Engel said all of the soldiers he talked with believed it was ''time to end this war.'' He closed his piece by telling Brian Williams, ''Earlier in the week some of the soldiers I was embedded with were hit by a larger I.E.D. That I.E.D. tore the door off the Humvee and the soldier inside had to have both of his legs amputated.''Senator Obama's capacity for leadership will be tested in large part by whether he can get the country to rally around his crucial point -- that all further progress on important issues here at home depends on whether we can find the will to extricate ourselves from Iraq.Op-Ed ColumnistOne of the better-kept secrets in the U.S. is the wide reach and extraordinary commitment of Tavis Smiley.Mr. Smiley is reasonably well known as a media personality. He's the host of a television talk show broadcast on PBS five nights a week and a weekly radio show. He's also a regular commentator on the widely syndicated black-oriented radio program ''The Tom Joyner Morning Show.''But that doesn't begin to capture the ever-widening swirl of activities, projects, programs and initiatives set in motion by this energetic, fast-talking, charismatic advocate and mentor, described by The Times's Felicia R. Lee as ''a cultural phenomenon.''Largely out of the sight of the broader public, Mr. Smiley has quietly become one of the most effective black leaders in the nation. He's always in motion, giving speeches, meeting with national leaders, conducting annual seminars on the ''State of the Black Union'' and offering how-to tips on important aspects of daily life for African-Americans.Mr. Smiley constantly exhorts his followers and admirers to make better use of the traditional tools of advancement -- education, hard work, citizen activism -- to transcend the barriers of continued neglect and discrimination.Next June, thanks to Mr. Smiley, the major presidential candidates will meet in a pair of prime-time debates on PBS -- one for each party -- to focus on issues of concern to African-American voters. That has never happened before.About a year ago Mr. Smiley, who has written several books, edited a paperback titled ''The Covenant With Black America.'' It's a guidebook, on matters large and small, for African-Americans, offering information and advice on issues that range from the importance of a healthy diet to closing the digital divide.No one, except perhaps Mr. Smiley, expected much from the book. There's nothing in the way of pizzazz in it. There are no celebrity scandals, no sex, no drugs, no rock 'n' roll.''I said let's put a book together that's easy to read,'' said Mr. Smiley, ''and that lays out what each individual can do, what the community together can do and what the body politic should do about these problems.''Published by a little-known black-owned company in Chicago, Third World Press, the book became an astonishing success, rising to No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list.''That book went to No. 1 without any mainstream exposure,'' said Mr. Smiley. ''I didn't mention it on my NPR and PBS shows because I don't do that -- I don't use the shows to promote things that I'm connected to. Other than that, though, I drove the book as hard as I could.''But Oprah wouldn't touch it. 'The Today Show' wouldn't touch it. 'Good Morning America,' NPR, Larry King -- not a single mainstream media outlet said or did anything with that book. And it still went to No. 1. That tells me that there is a hunger and a thirst in black America for trying to turn this mess that we are in around.''For all of his 21st-century media savvy, Mr. Smiley is in many ways an old-fashioned, idealistic leader who has managed in an era saturated with cynicism to cling to the eternal verities. His hero is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He believes it is still possible for ordinary citizens to hold public officials accountable. (''I'm still baffled, befuddled,'' he says, ''by how the president did not even mention New Orleans or Katrina in his State of the Union speech.'') He speaks openly about the importance of bringing love -- yes, love -- into the public discourse.''When I was 13,'' he said, ''I vowed to God that that if I ever got the chance to make something of myself, I'd spend the rest of my life trying to love and serve other people. I still believe that love is the most powerful and transformative force in the world today. I love people and I get joy out of serving people.''The cynics, of course, will have a field day with this. But Mr. Smiley, on his way to catch a flight, or hop a train, or racing down the highway to his next event, will no doubt be too busy to notice. He's eager to do what he can about the sorry state of the public schools in the big cities, and the fact that there are too few jobs that pay a living wage, and all manner of other issues: child care, health care, the environment.He is trying to do nothing less than generate a movement among black Americans that will ''help make all of America better.''The companion volume to ''The Covenant'' was published two weeks ago. It's called ''The Covenant in Action.''Op-Ed ColumnistIf we could manage to get past the tedious and the odious -- like the empty speculation on whether a woman can win, or whether Barack Obama is black enough -- we might be able to engage the essential issue facing the U.S. at this point in our history.And that is whether, once the Bush administration has finally and mercifully run its course, the country goes back to being a reasonably peaceful, lawful, constructive force in the world, or whether we continue down the bullying, warlike, unilateral, irresponsible, unlawful and profoundly ineffective path laid out by Bush, Cheney & Co.The question is not so much whether a Republican or a Democrat takes the White House in the next election; it's whether the American people can take back their country.I don't think most Americans are up for perennial warfare. And whatever the polls might say, it's very hard for me to accept that the men and women who rise from their seats and cover their hearts at the start of sporting events are really in favor of dismantling the system of checks and balances, or holding people in prison for years without charging them, or torturing prisoners in U.S. custody, or giving the president the raw power and unsavory privileges of an emperor.It was Richard Nixon who said, ''When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.''George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, operating behind the mammoth fig leaf of national security, took this theoretical absurdity to heart and put it into widespread practice.There are, however, many thoughtful Americans who want to stop this calamitous disregard for the rule of law, two of whom I'll mention today -- Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. and Senator Chris Dodd.Mr. Schwarz is one of the most decent men I've known. I covered him when he was the chief lawyer for New York City during the Koch administration. He was then, and still is, the quintessential straight arrow.In the 1970s Mr. Schwarz was chief counsel for the Church Committee (named after its chairman, Senator Frank Church), which uncovered extraordinary abuses and led to historic changes in the nation's intelligence services. He is now the senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School.To say that Mr. Schwarz is disturbed by some of the things that have occurred during the presidency of George W. Bush is an understatement. In a book to be published next month by The New Press, ''Unchecked and Unbalanced: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror,'' Mr. Schwarz and a colleague at the Brennan Center, Aziz Z. Huq, write:''For the first time in American history, the executive branch claims authority under the Constitution to set aside laws permanently -- including prohibitions on torture and warrantless eavesdropping on Americans. A frightening idea decisively rejected at America's birth -- that a president, like a king, can do no wrong -- has reemerged to justify torture and indefinite presidential detention.''Undermining checks and balances here at home and acting unilaterally abroad have made us less safe, said Mr. Schwarz. Some of the actions the U.S. has taken ''have so hurt our reputation,'' he said, ''that Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay have become in many eyes more the symbol of America than the Statue of Liberty.''Senator Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is running for president, has introduced legislation that would definitively bar the use of evidence obtained by torture or coercion, reinstate full U.S. adherence to the Geneva Conventions and restore rights of habeas corpus for certain terror suspects that were stripped away by the federal government last year.(Habeas corpus is a legal proceeding that allows suspects to challenge their detention in a court of law. To get a sense of its significance, imagine that you were locked up somewhere and were not permitted to show that a mistake had been made, that you were innocent. Imagine that you, or a loved one, were held under those circumstances for a period of years, or forever.)Senator Dodd said this corrosion of the rule of law has been tolerated primarily because ''people have been frightened.'' As he put it, in an atmosphere of crisis, ''the temptation to succumb to the demagoguery of these things is strong.''The senator and Mr. Schwarz, in their different ways, are among the many quiet patriots who are spreading the word that the very meaning of the United States, the whole point of this fragile experiment in representative democracy, will be lost if the nation's ironclad commitment to the rule of law is allowed to unravel.Op-Ed ColumnistHave they buried Anna Nicole Smith yet?Are you kidding? Ms. Smith may be dead and rapidly decomposing, but there's too much fun still to be reaped from her story to let it die just yet. This is world-class entertainment: Larry King, ''Today,'' CNN, The New York Times.Even the judge in the televised hearing over what to do with Ms. Smith's remains is milking his 15 minutes, like Judge Ito of O. J. Simpson fame. In a burst of wisdom from the bench, the judge, Larry Seidlin, said, ''Like a Muhammad Ali fight, sometimes you have to wait the whole 10 rounds.''When we were kids we were taught not to laugh at people who were obviously mentally or emotionally disturbed. With Ms. Smith, who was deeply and unmistakably disturbed, we put her on television and laughed and laughed. Would she say something stupid, or spill out of her dress, or pass out in public from booze or drugs? How hysterically funny!Then her son died. Then she died, leaving an orphaned infant daughter. Instead of turning away chastened, shamed, we homed in like happy vultures. Whatever entertainment value Ms. Smith had when she was alive increased exponentially when she was kind enough to die for us. Now she's on the tube around the clock.The story, as they say, has legs.There are other stories out there, but they aren't nearly as much fun. The Times reported on Monday, for example, that Al Qaeda is getting its act together in Pakistan and is setting up training camps in an area that, apparently, we don't dare trespass in.According to the article, ''American officials said there was mounting evidence that Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, had been steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous Pakistani tribal area of North Waziristan.''The article went on to say, ominously, ''The United States has also identified several new Qaeda compounds in North Waziristan, including one that officials said might be training operatives for strikes against targets beyond Afghanistan.''I imagine that there are a fair number of television viewers and newspaper readers who have trouble distinguishing the relative importance of celebrity stories, like the death of Anna Nicole Smith, from other matters in the news, like the reconstitution of forces responsible for the devastating Sept. 11 attacks.If air time is any guide, there's no contest. It's been obvious for the longest time that the line between news and entertainment has vanished. News is entertainment. And the death of Anna Nicole Smith is more entertaining -- for the time being, at least -- than the war in Iraq or the plodding machinations of bin Laden and Zawahri.Paris Hilton and Britney Spears were on the cover of Newsweek last week with the headline ''The Girls Gone Wild Effect.'' When you turned to the story, there was a full-page picture of the former best friends, with a glassy-eyed Britney looking for all the world like a younger version of Anna Nicole Smith.The lead-in to the article said in large type: ''Paris, Britney, Lindsay and Nicole -- They seem to be everywhere and they may not be wearing underwear.''The nation may be at war, and Al Qaeda may be gearing up for a rematch. But that's no fun, not when Britney is shaving off her hair and Jennifer Aniston is reported to have a new nose and the thrill-a-minute watch over Anna Nicole's remains is still the hottest thing on TV.It was Neil Postman who warned in 1985 that we were amusing ourselves to death. I'm not sure anyone knew how literally to take him.More than 20 years later, the masses have nearly succeeded in drawing the curtains on anything that's not entertaining. No one can figure out what do about Iraq or Al Qaeda. A great American cultural center like New Orleans was all but washed away, and no one knows how to put it back together. The ice caps are melting and Al Gore is traveling the land like the town crier, raising the alarm about global warming.But none of that has really gotten the public's attention. None of it is amusing enough. As a nation of spectators, we seem content to sit with a pizza and a brew in front of the high-def flat-screen TV, obsessing over Anna Nicole et al., and giving no thought to the possibility that the calamitous events unfolding in the world may someday reach our doorsteps.Op-Ed ColumnistIf Bill and Hillary Clinton were the stars of a reality TV show, it would be a weekly series called ''The Connivers.'' The Clintons, the most powerful of power couples, are always scheming at something, and they're good at it.Their latest project is to contrive ways to knock Barack Obama off his white horse and muddy him up a little. A lot, actually.Most of the analyses after last week's dust-up over David Geffen's comments to Maureen Dowd have focused on whether the Clintons succeeded in tarnishing the junior senator from Illinois. What I found interesting was that no one questioned whether the Clintons would be willing to get down in the muck and start flinging it around. That was a given.When Senator Obama talks about bringing a new kind of politics to the national scene, he's talking about something that would differ radically from the relentlessly vicious, sleazy, mendacious politics that have plagued the country throughout the Bush-Clinton years. Whether he can pull that off is an open question. But there's no doubt the Clintons want to stop him from succeeding.Senator Obama has come riding out of the wilderness (all right, Chicago) to stand between the Clintons and their dream of returning to the White House and resuming what they will always see as the glory years of the 1990s.He hurts Senator Clinton in myriad ways. In all the uproar over Mr. Geffen's comments, hardly anyone has said they were wildly off the mark. There would be no Obama phenomenon if an awful lot of people weren't fed up with just the sort of mean-spirited, take-no-prisoners politics that the Clintons and the Bush crowd represent. Senator Obama -- at least for the time being -- is an extremely attractive alternative.Right behind that as a factor is the distinct possibility that Mr. Obama will ride off with the black vote, without which the Clintons are doomed. Those who joked that Bill Clinton was the first black president are now confronted with someone who might be the real deal.Senator Obama is also much freer to take fresh stands on the issues. His camp has been delighted, for example, to watch Senator Clinton twist herself into a pretzel on Iraq. From day care to health care to trade and beyond, Mr. Obama is free to offer something new. He's not tied to the Clinton experience, the Clintonian way of viewing the world.And, finally, this campaign is not the be-all and end-all for Senator Obama. More easily than the Clintons, he can afford to make mistakes. He does not have to win this election. He can fight another day. In the absence of any catastrophic misstep, he could be selected as a vice-presidential candidate this time around. (It's not too hard to imagine a John Edwards-Barack Obama pairing.) He can run again for president four years from now, or eight years from now.His future, as Yogi might have said, is all in front of him.The Clintons were fresh once. I remember the exhilarating bus tour they took with Al and Tipper Gore right after Bill Clinton won the Democratic presidential nomination in the summer of 1992. There was a spontaneous quality to that tour and a sense that these four young leaders represented a new dawn of American politics.Almost 15 years later, Hillary Clinton has to fight the perception that she is chasing yesterday's dawn. She has the benefit of universal name recognition, uniformly high poll numbers and trainloads of campaign cash. But she still gives the impression that she's riding the political high wire with the mixed blessing of Bill Clinton planted firmly on her shoulders.It's ironic that the first woman with a real shot at the presidency comes off not as a compelling underdog but as the powerful front-runner at the controls of a ruthless political machine.We'll have to wait and see whether Senator Obama is really offering a new, more hopeful brand of national politics. But here's a bit of unsolicited advice for a candidate making his first foray into the crucible of presidential politics:Don't listen to those who tell you not to fight back against the Clintons. You will not become president if you allow yourself to become their punching bag. Keep in mind the Swift-boating of John Kerry. Raising politics to a higher level does not mean leaving oneself defenseless.Op-Ed ColumnistThe Rev. Al Sharpton seemed subdued, quiet, reflective -- which was unusual.Just when we thought the news couldn't get any weirder, we learned this week, via The Daily News, that Mr. Sharpton's great-grandfather was a slave who was owned by relatives of Senator Strom Thurmond, the longtime archsegregationist who ran for president as a Dixiecrat in 1948.''There's not enough troops in the Army,'' Mr. Thurmond told a screaming crowd during that campaign, ''to force the Southern people to break down segregation and admit the nigra race into our theaters, into our swimming pools, into our schools and into our homes.''Mr. Sharpton seemed a little shaken by the revelation. ''You're always kind of thinking that your ancestors were slaves,'' he said. ''But this was my grandfather's father. I knew my grandfather. It's eerie when it becomes so personal.''The days of slavery are closer than we tend to think, and they were crueler than we tend to realize. Mr. Sharpton's great-grandfather, Coleman Sharpton, was sent with his wife and two children from South Carolina to Florida so a woman named Julia Thurmond Sharpton could send them out as laborers to pay off debts left by her late husband.Julia Sharpton was a first cousin, twice removed, of Strom Thurmond.''They were sent there solely for that reason,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''To make money to pay her debt. It was just so clear that they were nothing but property. The complete dehumanization -- I don't think I fully understood it until this hit home.''There's a great deal that Americans don't fully understand about slavery. It's such an uncomfortable subject that the temptation is to relegate it to the distant past and move on. But the long tentacles of that evil institution are still with us. Slavery was the foundation of the thriving consumer society that we have today and the wellspring of the racism that still poisons so many white attitudes and black lives.The sheer size of the phenomenon of slavery, which was woven into the very being of the early Americas, is not well known today. The historian David Brion Davis, in his book ''Inhuman Bondage,'' tells us:''By 1820 nearly 8.7 million slaves had departed from Africa for the New World, as opposed to only 2.6 million whites, many of them convicts or indentured servants, who had left Europe. Thus by 1820 African slaves constituted almost 77 percent of the enormous population that had sailed toward the Americas, and from 1760 to 1820 this emigrating flow included 5.6 African slaves for every European.''For most of the time between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, the United States was governed by presidents who owned slaves.One of the points Mr. Davis stressed was that the commodities produced in such tremendous volume by slaves -- sugar, tobacco, coffee, chocolate, cotton -- were crucial to the formation of the world's first global mass market.''From the very beginnings,'' wrote Mr. Davis, ''America was part black, and indebted to the appalling sacrifices of millions of individual blacks who cleared the forests and tilled the soil. Yet even the ardent opponents of slaveholding could seldom if ever acknowledge this basic fact.''Instead of reaping rewards for this seminal role in the creation of a rich and powerful nation, blacks have been relentlessly vilified by a profoundly racist society and frozen out of most of the nation's bounty. Consigned to the bottom of the caste heap after emancipation, and denied some of the most basic human rights, blacks became the convenient depository of whatever blame and negative stereotypes whites chose to cast their way.The abject state ruthlessly imposed upon blacks for so long became, perversely, proof of their inferiority. Blacks gave whites of all classes someone to look down upon.Slavery, like the past, as Faulkner reminded us, is not dead. It's not even past. It's not something that you can wish away.The other night Reverend Sharpton flew into Miami to attend a conference. At the airport someone asked for his autograph.''It was the first time in my life that I thought about why my name is Sharpton,'' he said. ''I mean this whole thing is as personal as why your name is what it is. You're named after someone who owned your great-grandparents.''Op-Ed ColumnistIt's an article of faith that the key to success in real estate is location, location, location.For young black boys looking ahead to a difficult walk in life, the mantra should be education, education, education.We've watched for decades -- watched in horror, actually -- as the lives of so many young blacks, men and boys especially, have been consumed by drugs, crime, poverty, ignorance, racial prejudice, misguided social pressures, and so on.At the same time, millions of blacks have thrived, building strong families and successful careers at rates previously unseen. By far, the most important difference between these two very large groups has been educational attainment.If anything, the role that education plays in the life prospects of black Americans is even more dramatic than in the population as a whole. It's the closest thing to a magic potion for black people that I can think of. For boys and men, it is very often the antidote to prison or an early grave.A new report from the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston tells us that young adults in general have been struggling in the labor market. Many have been left behind by the modest economic recovery of the past few years, especially those with limited education credentials.The report, which focuses on black males, emphasizes the importance of education in overcoming this tough employment environment:''For males in each of the three race-ethnic groups (blacks, Hispanics and whites), employment rates in 2005 increased steadily and strongly with their educational attainment. This was especially true for black males, for whom employment rates rose from a low of 33 percent among high school dropouts to 57 percent among high school graduates, and to a high of 86 percent among four-year college graduates.''The fact that only one of every three young black male high school dropouts was able to obtain any type of job during an average month in 2005 should be viewed as particularly distressing, since many of these young men will end up being involved in criminal activities during their late teens and early 20s and then bear the severe economic consequences for convictions and incarcerations over the remainder of their working lives.''There is no way, in my opinion, for blacks to focus too much or too obsessively on education. It's the fuel that powers not just the race for success but the quest for a happy life. It represents the flip side of failure.The differences in rates of employment between white men and black men narrow considerably as black men gain additional schooling. After comparing the percentage of the male population that is employed in each race or ethnic group, the Northeastern study found:''The gap in [employment to population] ratios between young white and black males narrows from 20 percentage points among high school dropouts, to 16 percentage points among high school graduates, to eight percentage points among those men completing 1-3 years of college, and to only two percentage points for four-year college graduates.''For anyone deluded enough to question whether education is the ticket to a better life for black boys and men, consider that a black male who drops out of high school is 60 times more likely to find himself in prison than one with a bachelor's degree.Black males who graduate from a four-year college will make, over the course of a lifetime, more than twice the mean earnings of a black high school graduate, which is a difference of more than a million dollars.According to the study, ''Black males with college degrees and strong literacy/math skills also are far more likely to marry and live with their children and pay substantially more in taxes to state and national government than they receive in cash and in-kind benefits.''This is not a close-call issue. It is becoming very hard for anyone to succeed in this society without a college education. To leave school without even a high school education, as so many males -- and especially black males -- are doing, is extremely self-destructive.The effort to bolster the educational background of black men has to begin very early. It's extremely difficult to turn a high school dropout into a college graduate. This effort can only succeed on a large scale if there is a cultural change in the black community -- a powerful change that acknowledges as the 21st century unfolds that there is no more important life tool for black children than education, education, education.Op-Ed ColumnistNeglect, incompetence, indifference, lies.Why in the world is anyone surprised that the Bush administration has not been taking good care of wounded and disabled American troops?Real-life human needs have never been a priority of this administration. The evidence is everywhere -- from the mind-bending encounter with the apocalypse in Baghdad, to the ruined residential neighborhoods in New Orleans, to the anxious families in homes across America who are offering tearful goodbyes to loved ones heading off to yet another pointless tour in Iraq.The trial and conviction of Scooter Libby opened the window wide on the twisted values and priorities of the hawkish operation in the vice president's office. No worry about the troops there.And President Bush has always given the impression that he is more interested in riding his bicycle at the ranch in Texas than in taking care of his life and death responsibilities around the world.That whistling sound you hear is the wind blowing across the emptiness of the administration's moral landscape.U.S. troops have been treated like trash since the beginning of Mr. Bush's catastrophic adventure in Iraq. Have we already forgotten that soldier from the Tennessee National Guard who dared to ask Donald Rumsfeld why the troops had to go scrounging in landfills for ''hillbilly armor'' -- scrap metal -- to protect their vehicles from roadside bombs?Fellow soldiers cheered when the question was raised, and others asked why they were being sent into combat with antiquated equipment. The defense secretary was not amused. ''You go to war with the Army you have,'' he callously replied, ''not the Army you might want or wish to have at a later time.''Have we forgotten that while most Americans have sacrificed zilch for this war, the mostly uncomplaining soldiers and marines are being sent into the combat zones for two, three and four tours? Multiple combat tours are an unconscionable form of Russian roulette that heightens the chances of a warrior being killed or maimed.In the old days, these troops would have been referred to as cannon fodder. However you want to characterize them now, their casually unfair treatment is an expression of the belief that they are expendable.The Washington Post has performed an important public service by shining a spotlight on the contemptible treatment that some soldiers received as outpatients at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.The series has already prompted Congressional hearings, and the president climbed off his bicycle long enough to appoint the requisite commission. The question is whether Congress and the public can be roused to take action on behalf of the troops.It's not just the indifference and incompetence of the administration that are causing the troops so much unnecessary suffering. The simple truth is that the Bush crowd, busy trying to hide the costs of the president's $2 trillion tragedy in Iraq, can't find the money to pay for all the care that's needed by the legions of wounded and mentally disabled troops who are coming home. The outpatient fiasco at Walter Reed is just one aspect of a vast superstructure of suffering.The military is overextended and falling apart. Equipment worn out or destroyed by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has to be replaced. The perennial, all-consuming appetite of the military-industrial complex has to be satisfied. And now, here comes that endless line of wounded men and women, some of them disabled for life.How is all of this to be paid for?The administration has tried its best to keep the reality of the war away from the public at large, to keep as much of the carnage as possible behind the scenes. No pictures of the coffins coming home. Limited media access to Walter Reed.That protective curtain needs to be stripped away, exposing the enormity of this catastrophe for all to see.I remember walking the quiet, manicured grounds of Walter Reed on an unauthorized visit and seeing the young men and women moving about in wheelchairs or on crutches. Some were missing two and three limbs. All had suffered grievously.There is something profoundly evil about a country encouraging young men and women to go off and fight its wars and then shortchanging them on medical care and other forms of assistance when they come back with wounds that will haunt them forever.That's something most Americans never thought their country would do.Op-Ed ColumnistA must-read for anyone who favors an expansion of guest worker programs in the U.S. is a stunning new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center that details the widespread abuse of highly vulnerable, poverty-stricken workers in programs that already exist.The report is titled ''Close to Slavery: Guestworker Programs in the United States.'' It will be formally released today at a press conference in Washington.Workers recruited from Mexico, South America, Asia and elsewhere to work in American hotels and in such labor-intensive industries as forestry, seafood processing and construction are often ruthlessly exploited.They are routinely cheated out of their wages, which are low to begin with. They are bound like indentured servants to the middlemen and employers who arrange their work tours in the U.S. And they are virtual hostages of the American companies that employ them.The law does not allow these ''guests'' to change jobs while they're here. If a particular employer is unscrupulous, as is very often the case, the worker has little or no recourse.One of the guest workers profiled in the report was a psychology student recruited in the Dominican Republic to work at a hotel in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The woman had taken on $4,000 in debt to cover ''fees'' and other expenses that were required for her to get a desk job that paid $6 an hour.But after a month, her hours were steadily reduced until she was working only 15 or 20 hours a week. That left her with barely enough money to survive, and with no way of paying off her crushing debt.The woman and her fellow guest workers had hardly enough money for food. ''We would just buy Chinese food because it was the cheapest,'' she said. ''We would buy one plate a day and share it between two or three people.'' She told the authors of the report: ''I felt like an animal without claws -- defenseless. It is the same as slavery.''Steven Greenhouse of The Times recently reported on a waiter from Indonesia who took on $6,000 in debt to become a guest worker. He arrived in North Carolina expecting to do farm work but found that there was no job for him at all.The report focused primarily on the 120,000 foreign workers who are allowed into the U.S. each year to work on farms or at other low-skilled jobs. In most cases the guest workers take on a heavy debt load to participate in the program, anywhere from $500 to more than $10,000. Worried about the welfare of their families back home, and with the huge debt hanging over their heads, the workers are most often docile, even in the face of the most egregious treatment.The result, said the report, is that they are ''systematically exploited and abused.''Some of the worst abuses occur in the forestry industry. The report said, ''Virtually every forestry company that the Southern Poverty Law Center has encountered provides workers with pay stubs showing that they have worked substantially fewer hours than they actually worked.''A favorite (and extremely cruel) tactic of employers is the seizure of guest workers' identity documents, such as passports and Social Security cards. That leaves the workers incredibly vulnerable.''Numerous employers have refused to return these documents even when the worker simply wanted to return to his home country,'' the report said. ''The Southern Poverty Law Center also has encountered numerous incidents where employers destroyed passports or visas in order to convert workers into undocumented status.''Without their papers the workers live in abject fear of encountering the authorities, who will treat them as illegals. They are completely at the mercy of the employers.President Bush has been relentless in his push to greatly expand guest worker programs as part of his effort to revise the nation's immigration laws. To expand these programs without looking closely at the gruesome abuses already taking place would be both tragic and ridiculous.''This is not a situation where there are just a few bad-apple employers,'' said Mary Bauer, director of the Immigrant Justice Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has initiated a number of lawsuits on behalf of abused workers. ''Our experience is that it's the very structure of the program that lends itself to abuse.''Op-Ed ColumnistThe national unemployment rate came in at 4.5 percent last week and was generally characterized as pretty good. But whatever universe those numbers came from, it was not the universe that black men live in.Black American males inhabit a universe in which joblessness is frequently the norm, where the idea of getting up each morning and going off to work can seem stranger to a lot of men than the dream of hitting the lottery, where the dignity that comes from supporting oneself and one's family has too often been replaced by a numbing sense of hopelessness.What I'm talking about is extreme joblessness -- joblessness that is coursing through communities and being passed from one generation to another, like a deadly virus.Forget, for a moment, the official unemployment numbers. They understate the problem of joblessness for all groups. Far more telling is the actual percentage of people in a given segment of the working-age population that is jobless.Black men who graduate from a four-year college do reasonably well in terms of employment, compared with other ethnic groups. But most black men do not go to college. In big cities, more than half do not even finish high school.Their employment histories are gruesome. Over the past few years, the percentage of black male high school graduates in their 20s who were jobless (including those who abandoned all efforts to find a job) has ranged from well over a third to roughly 50 percent. Those are the kinds of statistics you get during a depression.For dropouts, the rates of joblessness are staggering. For black males who left high school without a diploma, the real jobless rate at various times over the past few years has ranged from 59 percent to a breathtaking 72 percent.''Seventy-two percent jobless!'' said Senator Charles Schumer, chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, which held a hearing last week on joblessness among black men. ''This compares to 29 percent of white and 19 percent of Hispanic dropouts.''Senator Schumer described the problem of black male unemployment as ''profound, persistent and perplexing.''Jobless rates at such sky-high levels don't just destroy lives, they destroy entire communities. They breed all manner of antisocial behavior, including violent crime. One of the main reasons there are so few black marriages is that there are so many black men who are financially incapable of supporting a family.''These numbers should generate a sense of national alarm,'' said Senator Schumer.They haven't. However much this epidemic of joblessness may hurt, very little is being done about it. According to the Labor Department, only 97,000 new jobs were created in February. That's not even enough to accommodate new entrants to the work force.And then there's the question of who's getting the new jobs. According to statistics compiled by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, the only groups that have experienced a growth in jobs since the last recession are older workers and immigrants.People can howl all they want about how well the economy is doing. The simple truth is that millions of ordinary American workers are in an employment bind. Steady jobs with good benefits are going the way of Ozzie and Harriet. Young workers, especially, are hurting, which diminishes the prospects for the American family. And blacks, particularly black males, are in a deep danger zone.Instead of addressing this issue constructively, government officials have responded by eviscerating programs that were designed to move young people from disadvantaged backgrounds into the labor market.Robert Carmona, president of Strive, an organization that helps build job skills, told Senator Schumer's committee, ''What we've seen over the last several years is a deliberate disinvestment in programs that do work.''What's needed are massive programs of job training and job creation, and a sustained national effort to bolster the education backgrounds of disadvantaged youngsters. So far there has been no political will to do any of that.You get lip service. But when you walk into the neighborhoods and talk to the young people, you find that very little, if anything, is being done. Which is why the real-world employment environment has become so horrendous for so many.Op-Ed ColumnistJeffrey Lucey was 18 when he signed up for the Marine Reserves in December 1999. His parents, Kevin and Joyce Lucey of Belchertown, Mass., were not happy. They had hoped their son would go to college.Jeffrey himself was ambivalent.''The recruiter was a very smooth talker and very, very persistent,'' Ms. Lucey told me in a call from Orlando, Fla., where she was on vacation with her husband and their two grown daughters last week. The conversation was difficult. Ms. Lucey would talk for a while, and then her husband would get on the phone.''We see him everywhere,'' Ms. Lucey said. ''Every little dark-haired boy you see, it looks like Jeff. If we see a parent reprimanding a child, it's like you want to go up and say, 'Oh, don't do that, because you don't know how long you're going to have him.' ''The war in Iraq began four years ago today. Fans at sporting events around the U.S. greeted the war and its early ''shock and awe'' bombing campaign with chants of ''U.S.A.! U.S.A.!''Jeffrey Lucey, who turned 22 the day before the war began, had a different perspective. He had no illusions about the glory or glamour of warfare. His unit had been activated and he was part of the first wave of troops to head into the combat zone.A diary entry noted the explosion of a Scud missile near his unit: ''The noise was just short of blowing out your eardrums. Everyone's heart truly skipped a beat.  Nerves are on edge.''By the time he came home, Jeffrey Lucey was a mess. He had gruesome stories to tell. They could not all be verified, but there was no doubt that this once-healthy young man had been shattered by his experiences.He had nightmares. He drank furiously. He withdrew from his friends. He wrecked his parents' car. He began to hallucinate.In a moment of deep despair on the Christmas Eve after his return from Iraq, Jeffrey hurled his dogtags at his sister Debra and cried out, ''Don't you know your brother's a murderer?''Jeffrey exhibited all the signs of deep depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Wars do that to people. They rip apart the mind and the soul in the same way that bullets and bombs mutilate the body. The war in Iraq is inflicting a much greater emotional toll on U.S. troops than most Americans realize.The Luceys tried desperately to get help for Jeffrey, but neither the military nor the Veterans Administration is equipped to cope with the war's mounting emotional and psychological casualties.On the evening of June 22, 2004, Kevin Lucey came home and called out to Jeffrey. There was no answer. He noticed that the door leading to the basement was open and that the light in the basement was on. He did not see the two notes that Jeffrey had left on the first floor for his parents:''It's 4:35 p.m. and I am near completing my death.''''Dad, please don't look. Mom, just call the police -- Love, Jeff.''The first thing Mr. Lucey saw as he walked down to the basement was that Jeff had set up an arrangement of photos. There was a picture of his platoon, and photos of his sisters, Debra and Kelly, his parents, the family dog and himself.''Then I could see, through the corner of my eye, Jeff,'' said Mr. Lucey. ''And he was, I thought, standing there. Then I noticed the hose around his neck.''The Luceys hope that in talking about their family's tragedy they will bring more attention to the awful struggle faced by so many troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other emotional illnesses. ''We hear of so many suicides,'' said Mr. Lucey.Ms. Lucey added, ''We thought that if we told other people about Jeffrey they might see their loved ones mirrored in him, and maybe they would be more aggressive, or do something different than we did. We didn't feel we had the knowledge we needed and we lost our child.''The Luceys are more than just concerned and grief-stricken. They're angry. They've joined an antiwar organization, Military Families Speak Out, and they want the war in Iraq brought to an end. ''That's the only way to prevent further Jeffreys from happening,'' Ms. Lucey said.Mr. Lucey made no effort to hide his bitterness over the government's failure to address many of the critical needs of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. His voice quivered as he said, ''When we hear anybody in the administration get up and say that they support the troops, it sickens us.''Op-Ed ColumnistOne of the weirder things at work these days is the fact that we're making it more difficult for American youngsters to afford college at a time when a college education is a virtual prerequisite for establishing and maintaining a middle-class standard of living.Young men and women are leaving college with debt loads that would break the back of a mule. Families in many cases are taking out second mortgages, loading up credit cards and raiding 401(k)s to supplement the students' first wave of debt, the ubiquitous college loan.At the same time, many thousands of well-qualified young men and women are being shut out of college, denied the benefits and satisfactions of higher education, because they can't meet the ever-escalating costs.You want a recipe for making the U.S. less competitive over the next few decades? This is it.Traditionally, one of the sweetest periods in the lives of many college graduates has been the time immediately after leaving school, when they could relax and take the measure of the newly emerging adult world. It was a time, perhaps, to travel, or to sample intriguing employment opportunities, even if they didn't pay particularly well. Debt was not usually the overriding concern of the young graduate.That has changed. Along with their degree, most graduates leave college now with a loan obligation that will hover over them for years, maybe decades. Student loans have decisively overtaken grants as the primary form of financial aid for undergraduates.Two-thirds of all graduates now leave college with some form of debt. The average amount is close to $20,000. Some owe many times that.Tamara Draut, in her book, ''Strapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead,'' tells us:''Back in the 1970s, before college became essential to securing a middle-class lifestyle, our government did a great job of helping students pay for school. Students from modest economic backgrounds received almost free tuition through Pell grants, and middle-class households could still afford to pay for their kids' college.''Since then, tuition at public and private universities has soared while government support for higher education, other than student loan programs, has diminished.This is a wonderful example of extreme stupidity. America will pony up a trillion or two for a president who goes to war on a whim, but can't find the money to adequately educate its young. History has shown that these kinds of destructive trade-offs are early clues to a society in decline.At the state level, per-pupil spending for higher education is at a 25-year low, even as government officials and corporate leaders keep pounding out the message that a college degree is the key to a successful future.Ms. Draut, director of the Economic Opportunity Program at Demos, a public policy group in New York, got to the heart of the matter in her recent testimony before a U.S. Senate committee looking into higher education costs.''The fundamental problem,'' she said, ''is rooted in the reality that our government no longer really helps people pay for college -- it helps them go into debt for college. The question we need to be asking is not, 'How much student loan debt is reasonable?' but, 'What is the best way to help students afford college?' ''The kids who graduate with enormous debt burdens -- $40,000, $80,000, $100,000 or more -- face a range of uncomfortable and even debilitating consequences, the first of which is the persistent anxiety over how their loans are to be repaid.I've spoken recently with a number of law students who have already decided to go into corporate practice because their first choice -- public interest law -- would not pay enough to cover their loans. Many students have turned their backs on teaching for the same reason.At that stage of life, you shouldn't have to choose between a job you would love and one that you would take simply because it would pay the bills. Talk about stepping on a dream.There are also plenty of cases of students who have postponed marriage or buying a home or having children because of their college loan obligations.And then there are those who never see a graduation day. There's no way of telling what talents have been squandered, or what great benefits to society have been lost, because bright students who were unable to afford the costs have been forced to leave college, or never went to college at all.In a nation as rich as ours, it should be easy to pay for college. For some reason, we find it easier to pay for wars.Op-Ed ColumnistJohn and Elizabeth Edwards managed to keep smiling last week as their lives once again took a terrible turn. The former senator talked about the importance of staying tough. Mrs. Edwards, whose breast cancer has metastasized, said, ''We're going to always look for the silver lining.''The public looked on, wondering what to make of the inexplicable. Fate seems to have toyed with the Edwardses, throwing the cruelest of twists into lives otherwise filled with so much good fortune.''We've been confronted with these kinds of traumas and struggles already in our lives,'' Mr. Edwards said, referring to the loss of their 16-year-old son Wade, who was killed in a car accident in 1996, and Mrs. Edwards's initial fight against the cancer that was discovered at the end of the 2004 campaign.This latest setback, he said, would not stop his current run for the presidency.Since presidential campaigns are covered like sporting events, the speculation immediately centered on whether Mrs. Edwards's illness would harm her husband's fund-raising ability, or cause him to go up or down in the polls, or in some other way hamper or enhance his ability to compete.The pack is obsessed with the horse race, which is regrettable. It would be far more constructive and interesting if this heightened attention to Mr. Edwards's campaign resulted in the media and the public taking a closer look at the issues he has been pushing, not just in the campaign but ever since his unsuccessful run for vice president in 2004.If that were to happen it could be part of the silver lining that Elizabeth Edwards hopes will emerge from her family's latest devastating crisis.The 2008 presidential campaign has gotten an absurdly early start and has drawn staggering amounts of media coverage. The result has largely been the triumph of the trivial: Who said what nasty thing about whom? Who flipped? Who flopped?Substance is considered boring, and thus less newsworthy. How many people really know, for example, what Mr. Edwards proposes to do about health care?He has, in fact, put together what is probably the most coherent plan for universal coverage of all the candidates thus far. Among other things, he would require employers to either provide coverage or contribute to a fund that would help individuals purchase private insurance.He wants to expand Medicaid and CHIP, the successful Children's Health Insurance Program. And he has said that he would help pay for his initiatives by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for people making more than $200,000 annually.Mr. Edwards and other candidates have offered many important ideas and proposals, but they tend to get lost in a media environment that focuses obsessively on front-runners. What's Hillary up to, and where's Barack? Are Rudy's kids talking to him yet?Mr. Edwards is one of the few candidates to talk seriously about ending poverty in the U.S. and fighting the ravages of poverty abroad. He once told me: ''I feel passionately about this. We have a moral obligation to do what we can. And we can do a lot more than most people realize.''A closer look at John Edwards's views on health care, poverty and other issues would require, of course, a closer look at the positions of the other candidates. What could be better? What's the sense of having a presidential campaign that takes up the better part of two years if the bulk of that time is spent on foolishness?Elizabeth Edwards's illness is a logical catalyst for a national discussion about health care in the U.S. But why stop there? Next year's election will be one of the most important in history. Whatever you think of their politics, John and Elizabeth Edwards are giving the country a world-class lesson in courage and candor.You want straight talk? ''I was wrong.'' That's what John Edwards said about his vote to authorize the president to go to war in Iraq. ''The world desperately needs moral leadership from America,'' he said, as he acknowledged his contribution to the debacle, ''and the foundation for moral leadership is telling the truth.''The war goes on, and fate has dealt the Edwards family another devastating blow. The rest of us can help invest the absurdity of their tragedy with meaning by paying closer attention to the issues that are important to them. Whether one ends up agreeing with them or not, it's a way of opening the door to a more thoughtful, rational way of selecting our presidents.Op-Ed ColumnistLarry Chapman is a firefighter, and during an interview the other day I couldn't help but notice the burns from a recent fire that circled both of his wrists. He shrugged them off. Part of the job.He and I were talking about something that bothered him a lot more. He's an American citizen, lives in the nation's capital, has kept his nose clean his entire life and has always had a strong interest in national politics and government.So why, he wanted to know, should he be denied the right to be represented in Congress?President Bush was on television yesterday explaining why he feels it's so important to keep fighting the war in Iraq. Nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens showed up to vote, he said, ''to express their will about the future of their country.''Supporting that effort, in Mr. Bush's view, is an important enough reason to send Americans off to fight and die in Iraq.But in Washington, D.C., which has more than a half million residents, American citizens are denied the right ''to express their will about the future of their country'' by voting for members of Congress. And Mr. Bush has not only opposed their effort to right this egregious wrong, he has threatened to veto legislation that would give these D.C. residents -- hold your breath -- one seat in the House of Representatives.Someone please explain why the president is sending young Americans to fight and die for democracy abroad while working vigorously to deny the spread of democracy to American citizens here at home.''Just because I live here,'' said Mr. Chapman, ''I'm denied the fundamental rights of every other American in the United States. That is messed up.''The slogan on license plates in the district is ''Taxation Without Representation.''There's a poster in wide circulation in the city, put out by DC Vote, a group that has campaigned hard for an expansion of voting rights. It shows two firefighters in full gear. One is Mr. Chapman, and the other is Jayme Heflin, who lives in Maryland. The poster says:''Both will save your life. Only ONE has a vote in Congress -- Washington D.C.'s nearly 600,000 residents include firefighters, nurses, teachers and small business owners. They pay federal taxes like all Americans, but are denied representation in Congress. That's taxation without representation -- and it's still wrong.''This denial of a fundamental voting right is especially significant at this moment in history. The executive branch is under the control of a belligerent and often amateurish group that has hacked away at civil liberties and is adamant about pursuing a war that neither Congress nor the public wants.The rest of the nation's business, including the economy, which looks increasingly like it may be going south, has been neglected. Nothing was more basic to the establishment of a co-equal legislative branch than the idea that it would serve as a check on a runaway executive.And yet the residents of Washington (who can vote for president) are prevented from having any real say in the business of the legislature. (Eleanor Holmes Norton serves as a nonvoting delegate from the District.) There are, in fact, some Republicans who have stepped up valiantly on behalf of voting rights for the District. Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican, has been a leader in the fight to have a Congressional seat established.But President Bush and some of his mean-spirited, antidemocratic allies are determined at all costs to prevent this expansion of the franchise to decent, honorable Americans.The threat of a presidential veto was already in the air as the House moved close to a vote last week on legislation to create the Congressional seat. And then the entire process was sabotaged when the sleazoids from the gun lobby, acting with their usual hypocrisy and bad faith, tried to insert language that would demolish the District's gun control laws.The legislation was pulled, to the delight of the mischief-makers. Democrats said they will try to bring the matter up for a vote again soon, without the offending language.This is another example of serious matters not being taken seriously in this country. President Bush and the bozos in the gun lobby probably got a chuckle out of their last-minute legislative maneuver. So clever of them.But the real issue is the continued denial of a vote -- something of tremendous value -- to men and women who want and deserve more of a say in the important matters facing their country.Op-Ed ColumnistThe actor Gary Sinise, who was talented enough to play both Harry Truman and George Wallace convincingly, has for many years been the prototype of the person who believes that supporting American troops requires more than simply waving the flag or plastering a bumper sticker on your S.U.V.Quiet and unassuming in an era when entertainers seem more desperate than ever to draw any kind of attention to themselves (think of Tom Cruise using Oprah's sofa as a trampoline), Mr. Sinise has been quietly entertaining the troops, supporting veterans organizations, recruiting veterans for theatrical projects and doing whatever else he could think of over the past quarter century to help the men and women who have served in the armed forces.(Believe it or not, the low-keyed Mr. Sinise can rock. He plays bass in the Lt. Dan Band, a group named after a movie character, Lt. Dan Taylor, a disabled Vietnam veteran played by Mr. Sinise in ''Forrest Gump.'')Mr. Sinise's latest campaign is to bring severely wounded American veterans out of the shadows and into the forefront of the nation's consciousness to help ensure that they get the care and the level of honor and respect that they deserve. He is the national spokesman for a project called the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, which will be the nation's first public tribute to the legions of men and women who are living with, and often still suffering from, wounds that they sustained while fighting in the nation's wars.It's interesting that an actor is one of the leaders of a campaign that will evoke the terrible hardships and real sacrifices of war as opposed to the glorified, sanitized rough and tumble that so often passes for warfare in Hollywood and on TV.During a recent conversation with Mr. Sinise, I kept thinking of the many wounded soldiers and marines I've interviewed since the war in Iraq began -- courageous individuals like Sgt. Eugene Simpson Jr., a former athlete from Dale City, Va., who was paralyzed when his spinal cord was severed in a roadside bombing; and Sgt. Tyler Hall, a baby-faced 23-year-old tough guy from Wasilla, Alaska, who made wisecracks about the bomb attack that shattered part of his face, broke his arm and three bones in his back, and caused him to lose his left leg below the knee.''We need to remember,'' Mr. Sinise said, ''that of the 26 million veterans living today, more than 3 million are permanently disabled from injuries suffered in our nation's defense.''The disabled veterans memorial will cost $65 million, all to be raised from private sources, and will be built on a two-acre site in the heart of the nation's capital, across from the U.S. Botanic Gardens. The memorial grew out of conversations that began more than a decade ago between the philanthropist Lois B. Pope and officials at Disabled American Veterans, an indispensable advocacy group that is headquartered in Washington.Whether a particular war is popular or not, wise or not, should have no bearing on how the country treats those who volunteer to serve in the armed forces, are ordered into combat and then come home wounded.The memorial will be a reminder of their continuing sacrifice, and a reminder as well of how unconscionable it is when politicians and bureaucrats cut corners on the care we give to veterans.Last Friday, during a visit to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, President Bush apologized to outpatient troops who had been housed in rundown quarters and forced to run a bureaucratic gantlet to get services to which they were entitled.The foul-ups and the neglect mentioned by the president are symptomatic of widespread problems faced by wounded troops returning from combat. Most of those problems are never brought to the attention of the public. The troops, for the most part, suffer in silence.The problems faced by some of the wounded troops after they come home would be more difficult to overlook if the country paid more attention to all of the troops who are wounded in the nation's wars.''We honor our fallen, those who have given their lives,'' said Mr. Sinise. ''But what about the ones who have sacrificed an arm or a leg, or their entire body to burns? Or the ones who can't see anymore? Or can't hear anymore?''They go through their lives constantly reminded of what they have sacrificed for their country. We need to let them know that the nation is grateful for their sacrifice.''Op-Ed ColumnistFifty-nine years ago this week -- on April 3, 1948 -- President Truman signed the legislation establishing the Marshall Plan, which contributed so much to the rebuilding of postwar Europe. Now, more than half a century later, the U.S. can't even rebuild New Orleans.It doesn't seem able to build much of anything, really. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the U.S. infrastructure is in sad shape, and it would take more than a trillion and a half dollars over a five-year period to bring it back to a reasonably adequate condition.If there's a less sexy story floating around, I can't find it. It certainly can't compete with the Sanjaya Malakar saga, or with the claim by Keith Richards that he snorted his dad's ashes with ''a little bit of blow.''But, as we learned with New Orleans, there are consequences to neglecting the infrastructure. Just a little over a year ago, a dam in Hawaii gave way, unleashing a wave 70 feet high and 200 yards wide. It swept away virtually everything in its path, including cars, houses and trees. Seven people drowned.On the day after Christmas in Portland, Ore., a sinkhole opened up like something from a science fiction movie and swallowed a 25-ton sewer-repair truck. Authorities blamed the sinkhole on the collapse of aging underground pipes.Blackouts, school buildings in advanced states of disrepair, decrepit highway and railroad bridges -- the American infrastructure is growing increasingly old and obsolete. In addition to being an invitation to tragedy, this is a problem that is putting Americans at a disadvantage in the ever more competitive global economy.Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker who helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s, has been prominent among those trying to sound the infrastructure alarm. Along with former Senator Warren Rudman, he has been criticizing the government's unwillingness to invest adequately in public transportation systems, water projects, dams, schools, the electrical grid, and so on.He recently told a House committee that Congress should begin a major effort to rebuild the American infrastructure ''before it is too late.''''Since the beginning of the republic,'' he said, ''transportation, infrastructure and education have played a central role in advancing the American economy, whether it was the canals in upstate New York, or the railroads that linked our heartland to our industrial centers; whether it was the opening of education to average Americans by land grant colleges and the G.I. bill, making education basic to American life; or whether it was the interstate highway system that ultimately connected all regions of the nation.''This did not happen by chance, but was the result of major investments financed by the federal and state governments over the last century and a half.  We need to make similar investments now.''Politics and ideology are the main reasons that government has turned away from public investment over the past several years. Zealots marching under the banner of small government have been remarkably effective in thwarting efforts to raise taxes or borrow substantial sums for the kind of public investment that has always been essential to a dynamic economy.That this is counterproductive in a post-20th-century world should be as obvious as the sun rising in the morning. There is a reason why countries like China and India are racing like mad to develop their infrastructure and educational capacity.''A modern economy needs a modern platform, and that's the infrastructure,'' Mr. Rohatyn said in an interview. ''It has been shown that the productivity of an economy is related to the quality of its infrastructure. For example, if you don't have enough schools to teach your kids, or your kids are taught in schools that have holes in the ceilings, that are dilapidated, they're not going to be as educated and as competitive in a world economy as they need to be.''Mr. Rohatyn and Mr. Rudman are co-chairmen of the Commission on Public Infrastructure at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. They believe that failing to move quickly to address the nation's infrastructure needs -- through the establishment of a national trust fund, for example, or a federal capital budget -- could lead to long-term disaster.But words like trust fund and long-term and infrastructure find it very difficult to elbow their way into the nation's consciousness. We may have to wait for another New Orleans before beginning to take this seriously.David Brooks is on vacation.When 6-year-old Desre'e Watson threw a tantrum in her kindergarten class a couple of weeks ago she could not have known that the full force of the law would be brought down on her and that she would be carted off by the police as a felon.But that's what happened in this small, backward city in central Florida. According to the authorities, there were no other options.''The student became violent,'' said Frank Mercurio, the no-nonsense chief of the Avon Park police. ''She was yelling, screaming -- just being uncontrollable. Defiant.''''But she was 6,'' I said.The chief's reply came faster than a speeding bullet: ''Do you think this is the first 6-year-old we've arrested?''The child's tantrum occurred on the morning of March 28 at the Avon Elementary School. According to the police report, ''Watson was upset and crying and wailing and would not leave the classroom to let them study, causing a disruption of the normal class activities.''After a few minutes, Desre'e was, in fact, taken to another room. She was ''isolated,'' the chief said. But she would not calm down. She flailed away at the teachers who tried to control her. She pulled one woman's hair. She was kicking.I asked the chief if anyone had been hurt. ''Yes,'' he said. At least one woman reported ''some redness.''After 20 minutes of this ''uncontrollable'' behavior, the police were called in. At the sight of the two officers, Chief Mercurio said, Desre'e ''tried to take flight.''She went under a table. One of the police officers went after her. Each time the officer tried to grab her to drag her out, Desre'e would pull her legs away, the chief said.Ultimately the child was no match for Avon Park's finest. The cops pulled her from under the table and handcuffed her. The officers were not fooling around. In the eyes of the cops the 6-year-old was a criminal, and in Avon Park she would be treated like any other felon.There was a problem, though. The handcuffs were not manufactured with kindergarten kids in mind. The chief explained: ''You can't handcuff them on their wrists because their wrists are too small, so you have to handcuff them up by their biceps.''As I sat listening to Chief Mercurio in a spotless, air-conditioned conference room at the Avon Park police headquarters, I had the feeling that I had somehow stumbled into the middle of a skit on ''Saturday Night Live.'' The chief seemed like the most reasonable of men, but what was coming out of his mouth was madness.He handed me a copy of the police report: black female. Six years old. Thin build. Dark complexion.Desre'e was put in the back of a patrol car and driven to the police station. ''Then,'' said Chief Mercurio, ''she was transported to central booking, which is the county jail.''The child was fingerprinted and a mug shot was taken. ''Those are the normal procedures for anyone who is arrested,'' the chief said.Desre'e was charged with battery on a school official, which is a felony, and two misdemeanors: disruption of a school function and resisting a law enforcement officer. After a brief stay at the county jail, she was released to the custody of her mother.The arrest of this child, who should have been placed in the care of competent, comforting professionals rather than being hauled off to jail, is part of an outlandish trend of criminalizing very young children that has spread to many school districts and law enforcement agencies across the country.A highly disproportionate number of those youngsters, like Desre'e, are black. In Baltimore last month, the police arrested, handcuffed and hauled away a 7-year-old black boy for allegedly riding a dirt bike on the sidewalk. The youngster was released and the mayor, Sheila Dixon, apologized for the incident, saying the arrest was inappropriate.Last spring a number of civil rights organizations collaborated on a study of disciplinary practices in Florida schools and concluded that many of them, ''like many districts in other states, have turned away from traditional education-based disciplinary methods -- such as counseling, after-school detention, or extra homework assignments -- and are looking to the legal system to handle even the most minor transgressions.''Once you adopt the mindset that ordinary childhood misbehavior is criminal behavior, it's easy to start seeing young children as somehow monstrous.''Believe me when I tell you,'' said Chief Mercurio, ''a 6-year-old can inflict injury to you just as much as any other person.''Op-Ed ColumnistYou knew something was up early in the day. As soon as I told executives at MSNBC that I was going to write about the ''60 Minutes'' piece, which was already in pretty wide circulation, they began acting very weird. We'll get back to you, they said.In a ''60 Minutes'' interview with Don Imus broadcast in July 1998, Mike Wallace said of the ''Imus in the Morning'' program, ''It's dirty and sometimes racist.''Mr. Imus then said: ''Give me an example. Give me one example of one racist incident.'' To which Mr. Wallace replied, ''You told Tom Anderson, the producer, in your car, coming home, that Bernard McGuirk is there to do nigger jokes.''Mr. Imus said, ''Well, I've nev -- I never use that word.''Mr. Wallace then turned to Mr. Anderson, his producer. ''Tom,'' he said.''I'm right here,'' said Mr. Anderson.Mr. Imus then said to Mr. Anderson, ''Did I use that word?''Mr. Anderson said, ''I recall you using that word.''''Oh, O.K.,'' said Mr. Imus. ''Well, then I used that word. But I mean -- of course, that was an off-the-record conversation. But ----''''The hell it was,'' said Mr. Wallace.The transcript was pure poison. A source very close to Don Imus told me last night, ''They did not want to wait for your piece to come out.''For MSNBC, Mr. Imus's ''nappy-headed ho's'' comment about the Rutgers women's basketball team was bad enough. Putting the word ''nigger'' into the so-called I-man's mouth was beyond the pale.The roof was caving in on Mr. Imus. More advertisers were pulling the plug. And Bruce Gordon, a member of the CBS Corp. board of directors and former head of the N.A.A.C.P., said publicly that Mr. Imus should be fired.But some of the most telling and persuasive criticism came from an unlikely source -- internally at the network that televised Mr. Imus's program. Women, especially, were angry and upset. Powerful statements were made during in-house meetings by women at NBC and MSNBC -- about how black women are devalued in this country, how they are demeaned by white men and black men.White and black women spoke emotionally about the way black women are frequently trashed in the popular culture, especially in music, and about the way news outlets give far more attention to stories about white women in trouble.Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC News who oversaw the Imus show for MSNBC, told me yesterday, ''It touched a huge nerve.''Whether or not Mr. McGuirk was hired for the specific noxious purpose referred to in the ''60 Minutes'' interview, he has pretty much lived up to that job description. He's a minstrel, a white man who has gleefully led the Imus pack into some of the most disgusting, degrading attempts at racial (not to mention sexist) humor that it's possible to imagine.Blacks were jigaboos, Sambos and Brilloheads. Women were bitches and, above all else, an endless variety of ever-ready sexual vessels, born to be degraded.The question now is how long the ''Imus in the Morning'' radio show will last. Just last month, in a reference to a speech by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Selma, Ala., Mr. McGuirk called Mrs. Clinton a bitch and predicted she would ''have cornrows and gold teeth'' by the time her presidential primary campaign against Senator Barack Obama is over.Way back in 1994, a friend of mine, the late Lars-Erik Nelson, a terrific reporter and columnist at The Daily News and Newsday, mentioned an Imus segment that offered a ''satirical'' rap song that gave advice to President Clinton on what to do about Paula Jones: ''Pimp-slap the ho.'' Mr. Nelson also wrote that there was a song on the program dealing with Hillary Clinton's menstrual cycle.So this hateful garbage has been going on for a long, long time. There was nothing new about the tone or the intent of Mr. Imus's ''nappy-headed ho's'' comment. As Bryan Monroe, president of the National Association of Black Journalists, told me the other night, ''It's a long pattern of behavior, and at some point somebody has to say enough is enough.''The crucial issue goes well beyond Don Imus's pathetically infantile behavior. The real question is whether this controversy is loud enough to shock Americans at long last into the realization of just how profoundly racist and sexist the culture is.It appears that on this issue the general public, and the women at Mr. Imus's former network, are far ahead of the establishment figures, the politicians and the media biggies, who were always so anxious to appear on the show and to defend Mr. Imus.That is a very good sign.Op-Ed ColumnistPeople in positions of great power are the ones who define those who are relatively lacking in power. So when Don Imus, a very powerful radio personality, dropped his disgusting verbal bomb on the members of the Rutgers women's basketball team, he sent a powerful message across the airwaves: that the young women on the team (the black ones, at least) were crude, ugly and genetically inferior, and that all of the women were whores.That message, which Mr. Imus insisted was meant to be funny, reinforced views already widely held in our society, which is why I could get the following e-mail from a reader:''Who woulda thunk that the Imus idiocy and the Duke Debacle would hit home on the same day. Both stories bring to mind what my father told me 60 years ago: Stay away from colored women.''The attention surrounding Mr. Imus's very public self-immolation is an opportunity for Americans to acknowledge that we have a problem. Not only is the society still permeated by racism and sexism and the stereotypes they spawn, but we have allowed a debased and profoundly immature culture to emerge in which the coarsest, most socially destructive images and language are an integral part of the everyday discourse.Gangsta rappers trapped in the throes of the Stockholm syndrome have spent years encouraging black people to see themselves as niggers and all women as whores. Michael Savage, one of the most prominent figures in talk radio, with an audience substantially larger than Don Imus's, has called Diane Sawyer a ''lying whore'' and Barbara Walters a ''double-talking slut,'' according to Media Matters for America, a group that monitors some of the excesses of talk radio.The culture that has given us such wonders as jazz, blues, baseball, Hollywood, the Broadway musical theater, rock 'n' roll, and on and on, is now specializing in too many instances in language and entertainment fit only for the gutter or a sewer.Something has gone completely haywire when young American boys and girls are listening to songs like, ''Can You Control Yo Hoe'' and ''Break a Bitch Til I Die,'' by Snoop Dogg, formerly Snoop Doggy Dogg, formerly Cordozar Calvin Broadus.''It's gotten pretty savage out there,'' said Tom Brokaw of NBC News during an on-air discussion of the Imus situation.Mr. Brokaw, who believes that firing Mr. Imus was the right thing to do, said: ''There's been an absence of civility in public discourse for some time now. The use of language across the racial spectrum, and across the political spectrum, and across the cultural spectrum, has been, in any way you want to describe it, debased to a certain degree.''The words that you hear used commonly on the street, or on the air, or on radio, or in rap lyrics, are words that in the worst days of segregation in this country, in the worst segregated parts of this country, you would not have heard on radio. Now you hear them commonly.''The language, of course, is just a symptom. Mr. Brokaw went on to mention, in a tone that sounded a bit sad and somewhat resigned, that Americans had steadfastly refused to face the race issue honestly and head-on. ''I had hoped,'' he said, ''I guess somewhat naïvely 20 years ago, that we would be in a far different place than we are now.''We should also be in a better place in the way that women are viewed and portrayed in the culture. And one of the first steps in a conversation about how to honestly address these issues should be a discussion of how to get more more blacks, other ethnic minorities and women into positions of real authority in the major news and entertainment outlets.Another part of the conversation should deal with why the bullying and degradation of other human beings is such a staple of popular entertainment in this country. One of the Rutgers players expressed astonishment Thursday night when Mr. Imus told her that making fun of people was how he'd made his living for many years.The people who fought back against the racism and misogyny of the ''Imus in the Morning'' program need to keep the momentum going. Keep the pressure on the companies that sponsor this garbage. Keep the matter before the media.Imus, Snoop Dogg, Michael Savage -- it doesn't matter where the bigotry is coming from. What's important is to find the integrity and the strength to see it for what it is -- a loathsome, soul-destroying disease -- and then to respond accordingly.Op-Ed Columnist''God I can't wait till I can kill you people.''-- A message on the Web site of the Columbine killer Eric Harris.In the predawn hours of Monday, Aug. 1, 1966, Charles Whitman, a former marine and Eagle Scout in Austin, Tex., stabbed his wife to death in their bed. The night before he had driven to his mother's apartment in another part of town and killed her.Later that Monday morning, Whitman gathered together food, water, a supply of ammunition, two rifles, a couple of pistols, a carbine and a shotgun and climbed the landmark 30-story tower on the campus of the University of Texas.Beneath a blazing sun, with temperatures headed toward the mid-90s, Whitman opened fire. His first target was a pregnant teenager. Over the next 80 or so minutes he killed 14 people and wounded more than 30 others before being shot to death by the police.More than four decades later we still profess to be baffled at the periodic eruption of murderous violence in places we perceive as safe havens. We look on aghast, as if the devil himself had appeared from out of nowhere. This time it was 32 innocents slaughtered on the campus of Virginia Tech. How could it have happened? We behave as if it was all so inexplicable.But a close look at the patterns of murderous violence in the U.S. reveals some remarkable consistencies, wherever the individual atrocities may have occurred. In case after case, decade after decade, the killers have been shown to be young men riddled with shame and humiliation, often bitterly misogynistic and homophobic, who have decided that the way to assert their faltering sense of manhood and get the respect they have been denied is to go out and shoot somebody.Dr. James Gilligan, who has spent many years studying violence as a prison psychiatrist in Massachusetts, and as a professor at Harvard and now at N.Y.U., believes that some debilitating combination of misogyny and homophobia is a ''central component'' in much, if not most, of the worst forms of violence in this country.''What I've concluded from decades of working with murderers and rapists and every kind of violent criminal,'' he said, ''is that an underlying factor that is virtually always present to one degree or another is a feeling that one has to prove one's manhood, and that the way to do that, to gain the respect that has been lost, is to commit a violent act.''Violence is commonly resorted to as the antidote to the disturbing emotions raised by the widespread hostility toward women in our society and the pathological fear of so many men that they aren't quite tough enough, masculine enough -- in short, that they might have homosexual tendencies.In a culture that is relentless in equating violence with masculinity, ''it is tremendously tempting,'' said Dr. Gilligan, ''to use violence as a means of trying to shore up one's sense of masculine self-esteem.''The Virginia Tech killer, Cho Seung-Hui, was reported to have stalked female classmates and to have leaned under tables to take inappropriate photos of women. A former roommate told CNN that Mr. Cho once claimed to have seen ''promiscuity'' when he looked into the eyes of a woman on campus.Charles Whitman was often portrayed as the sunny all-American boy. But he had been court-martialed in the Marines, was struggling as a college student and apparently had been suffering from depression. He told a psychiatrist that he absolutely hated his father, but he started his murderous spree by killing his wife and his mother.The confluence of feelings of inadequacy, psychosexual turmoil and the easy availability of guns has resulted in a staggering volume of murders in this country.There are nearly 200 million firearms in private hands in the U.S., and more than 30,000 people -- nearly 10 times the total number of Americans who have died in Iraq -- are killed by those guns each year. In 1966 Americans were being killed by guns at the rate of 17,000 a year. An article in The Times examining such ''rampages'' as the Charles Whitman shootings said:''Whatever the motivation, it seems clear that the way is made easier by the fact that guns of all sorts are readily available to Americans of all shades of morality and mentality.''We've learned very little in 40 years.Op-Ed ColumnistJust days after Don Imus was taken off the air for a slur hurled at members of the Rutgers women's basketball team, a police sergeant conducting a roll call at a precinct in Brooklyn is reported to have called the three female officers in the room ''hos'' as he gave them an order to stand up.The women, two of whom are black and one a Latina, refused to stand.Another officer, unable to resist the great ''fun'' of mocking his female colleagues, is reported to have called out, ''No, sergeant, not just hos, but nappy-headed hos.''The women said they were stunned almost to the point of disbelief by the comments. They were the only women in the gathering of 17 police officers in the room, including the supervising sergeant. There was a sickening quality to the moment. The women said they felt violated, hurt and humiliated.The incident occurred on April 15, a Sunday, at the 70th Precinct, which gained national notoriety in 1997 as the precinct in which Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, was sodomized by police officers with a broken broomstick.The three women, Tronnette Jackson, 36, Karen Nelson, 31, and Maria Gomez, 29, said they were attending a routine roll call session when Sgt. Carlos Mateo, referring to them, said, ''Stand up, hos.''The Imus controversy, in which Mr. Imus had referred to the Rutgers players as ''nappy-headed hos,'' was still big news and on everyone's mind. The three women remained seated.They said another police officer, Ralph Montanez, then chimed in: ''No, sergeant, not just hos, but nappy-headed hos.''The women remained silent, and seated.Sergeant Mateo is reported to have said, ''Jackson and Gomez, why aren't you standing?''Another police officer said to the sergeant, ''They are offended and they are protesting that you called them hos.''This is just one example of the myriad ways in which racist and sexist comments like Mr. Imus's help to poison the atmosphere all around us. Another example occurred two days prior to this incident when a narcotics sergeant in Queens is alleged to have ''jokingly'' said to a black female officer, ''Don't give me no lip or I'll have to call you a nappy-headed ho.''One of the toughest points to get across in this society is that racism and sexism are always contemptible, and are never harmless. The targets of racist and sexist comments should not just swallow the insults. They should react as if they'd been slapped in the face.The three women in the 70th Precinct case have decided to fight back. Their initial complaint to Sergeant Mateo, immediately after the roll call, was brushed aside, they said. They then complained to the precinct's integrity control officer and hired a lawyer, Bonita Zelman.This morning they will file a complaint in federal court, asserting that the degrading comments at the roll call amounted to illegal discrimination against them based on their gender and ethnic background. This is not a small matter. It's fair to wonder, for example, how eager a supervisor might be to recommend a major promotion for an employee he refers to as a ''ho.''''We have tremendous concern about the effect of language like this on women police officers,'' said Ms. Zelman, ''particularly women of color trying to make their way in the largely white male bureaucracy of a police department.''Also concerned about the effect of language like this is the police commissioner, Ray Kelly. Discussing the 70th Precinct case, he told me yesterday that he found the comments ''despicable.'' He declined to go into much detail because the matter is being investigated by the department's division of Equal Employment Opportunity.But the department let it be known that Sergeant Mateo had been transferred out of the 70th Precinct and would no longer be serving in a supervisory position. Both he and Officer Montanez could be subject to disciplinary charges.Commissioner Kelly said he found the entire matter ''very, very disturbing'' because the city had worked hard over the past few years to make the Police Department a place where women and minorities ''could feel at home.''The Queens narcotics sergeant is also likely to face disciplinary action by the department, which has been infected, like other organizations around the country, with what Ms. Zelman calls the ''Imus virus.''Op-Ed ColumnistTwo days after the massacre at Virginia Tech, a mentally disturbed man with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun opened fire in a house in Queens, killing his mother, his mother's disabled companion and the disabled man's health care aide. The gunman then killed himself.Sixteen months ago, in the basement of a private home in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, four aspiring rappers, aged 19 to 22, were summarily executed in a barrage of semiautomatic gunfire. Two teenagers were arrested five months later, and one was charged as the gunman.I had coffee the other day with Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, and she mentioned that since the murders of Robert Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, well over a million Americans have been killed by firearms in the United States. That's more than the combined U.S. combat deaths in all the wars in all of American history.''We're losing eight children and teenagers a day to gun violence,'' she said. ''As far as young people are concerned, we lose the equivalent of the massacre at Virginia Tech about every four days.''The first step in overcoming an addiction is to acknowledge it. Americans are addicted to violence, specifically gun violence. We profess to be appalled at every gruesome outbreak of mass murder (it's no big deal when just two, three or four people are killed at a time), but there's no evidence that we have the will to pull the guns out of circulation, or even to register the weapons and properly screen and train their owners.On the day after Christmas in 2000, an employee of Edgewater Technology, a private company in Wakefield, Mass., showed up at work with an assault rifle and a .12-gauge shotgun. Around 11 a.m. he began methodically killing co-workers. He didn't stop until seven were dead.An employee who had not been at work that day spoke movingly to a reporter from The Boston Globe about the men and women who lost their lives. ''They were some of the sweetest, smartest people I've ever had the chance to work with,'' he said. ''The cream of the crop.''The continuing carnage has roused at least one group of public officials to action: mayors. ''We see the violence that is happening in America today,'' said Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston. ''Illegal guns are rampant. Go into almost any classroom in Boston -- sixth and seventh grade, eighth grade, high school -- and 50 percent of those kids know somebody who had a gun.''The mayor noted that since the beginning of the year, more than 100 people have already been killed in Philadelphia, and nearly 80 in Baltimore. Most of the victims were shot to death.Last year Mayor Menino and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York, at a meeting they hosted at Gracie Mansion, organized a group of mayors committed to fighting against illegal firearms in the U.S. ''It is time for national leadership in the war on gun violence,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at the time. ''And if that leadership won't come from Congress or come from the White House, then it has to come from us.''The campaign has grown. There were 15 mayors at that first gathering. Now more than 200 mayors from cities in 46 states have signed on.When asked why Mayor Bloomberg had become so militant about the gun issue, John Feinblatt, the city's criminal justice coordinator, mentioned the ''human element.'' He said: ''I think it's because he's watched eight police officers be shot. And because, like all mayors, he's the one who gets awakened, along with the police commissioner, at 3 in the morning and 4 in the morning, and has to rush to the hospital and break the news that can break somebody's heart.''Those who are interested in the safety and well-being of children should keep in mind that only motor vehicle accidents and cancer kill more children in the U.S. than firearms. A study released a few years ago by the Harvard School of Public Health compared firearm mortality rates among youngsters 5 to 14 years old in the five states with the highest rates of gun ownership with those in the five states with the lowest rates.The results were chilling. Children in the states with the highest rates of gun ownership were 16 times as likely to die from an accidental gunshot wound, nearly seven times as likely to commit suicide with a gun, and more than three times as likely to be murdered with a firearm.Only a lunatic could seriously believe that more guns in more homes is good for America's children.Op-Ed ColumnistThe initial feeling is shock, and then comes anger, the anger bursting through even before the inevitable sadness sets in.Two people whom I respected a great deal were killed -- one of them insanely and the other absurdly -- in the past three weeks.Julia Campbell was a friend from several years back who had worked as a freelancer at The Times and a number of other media outlets before joining the Peace Corps and going off to the Philippines. I was watching the news on television about a week and a half ago when her photo came on the screen. The story said that she had been reported missing.A couple of days later the news came that she had been murdered. The authorities have arrested a man who said he bludgeoned her to death with a rock after she accidentally bumped into him.I remember once when we were hanging out, shooting the breeze about some horror in the news, Julia said to me, ''Why is the world the way it is?'' She added quickly, as though embarrassed: ''I know it's a ridiculous question. But I wonder.''David Halberstam died in the most ordinary of ways, like Camus, in the kind of car crash that is such an everyday occurrence it never warrants a second look unless the victim is a celebrity or someone we know.David and I weren't close, but we got along well. He was always exceptionally kind to me, very generous with sources and advice, and funny as hell with stories from his legendary past. It's a cliché, but he was a larger-than-life figure, a big, distinguished-looking man with a carefully cultivated baritone voice and a touch of pomposity that was tempered by a look in his eye and a hint of a smile that let you know that he knew exactly what he was doing.He was among the very best reporters I've ever known.If there was one thing above all else that David taught us, it was to be skeptical of official accounts, to stay always on guard against the lies, fabrications, half-truths, misrepresentations, exaggerations and all other manifestations of falsehood that are fired at us like machine-gun bullets by government officials and others in high places, often with lethal results.''You have to keep digging,'' he would say, ''keep asking questions, because otherwise you'll be seduced or brainwashed into the idea that it's somehow a great privilege, an honor, to report the lies they've been feeding you.''On the day after David was killed, a Congressional committee in Washington held a public hearing to explore the extraordinary lies concocted by the government to describe the killing of Cpl. Pat Tillman, a former N.F.L. football player, in Afghanistan, and the capture of Pfc. Jessica Lynch in the very early days of the war in Iraq.Corporal Tillman was killed by an American soldier in a friendly-fire incident. Instead of telling the truth, the military created an account in which Corporal Tillman, exhibiting extreme bravery, was cut down by enemy fire.Pat Tillman's younger brother, Kevin, appalled at what the government had done, told the committee how the corporal had been publicly praised and posthumously awarded the Silver Star for valor for what the Army described as his heroic confrontation with the ''well-armed enemy.''The only problem with the Army's account, said Kevin Tillman, was that ''it was utter fiction.''The initial account of the incident in which Private Lynch was taken prisoner (she was later rescued) was lifted straight from Hollywood, a typical macho fantasy of war. There was no validity to the story, and Private Lynch, very seriously wounded, had had nothing to do with it. Ms. Lynch told the committee that ''the story of the little girl Rambo from the hills of West Virginia who went down fighting'' was simply not true.She said she remains ''confused as to why they chose to lie.''A government that will lie about the tragic fates of honorable young Americans like Pat Tillman and Jessica Lynch will lie to the public about anything.One of the primary tasks of a journalist is to protect the public from such lies by exposing them, and by reporting the truth. David Halberstam was a master at that.In a larger sense, our job has to do with the question Julia Campbell asked in those days when her heart was set on a career in journalism. We don't know why the world is the way it is, but the job of the journalist is always in some sense to chase after the answer to that question.Op-Ed ColumnistPaul Rieckhoff looked across the crowded restaurant, which was not far from Times Square.''During World War II,'' he said, ''we could be in this place and there would be a guy sitting at that table who was in the war, or the bartender had been in the war. Everybody you saw would have had a stake in the war. But right now you could walk around New York for blocks and not find anybody who has been in Iraq.''The president can say we're a country at war all he wants. We're not. The military is at war. And the military families are at war. Everybody else is shopping.''Mr. Rieckhoff is an imposing six-foot-two-inch, 245-pound former infantry officer who joined the military after graduating from Amherst College. When he came home from a harrowing tour in Iraq in 2004, he vowed to do what he could to serve the interests of the men and women who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan but have never fully gotten the support they deserve from the government or the public at large.He wrote a book, ''Chasing Ghosts,'' which is now out in paperback, and he formed a powerful veterans' advocacy organization called Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.Mr. Rieckhoff is not bitter. He's actually funny and quite engaging (and a good writer). But he has very little tolerance for the negligence and incompetence the government has shown in equipping the troops and fighting the war in Iraq, and he is frustrated by the short shrift that he feels the troops get from the media and the vast majority of Americans.There's a gigantic and extremely disturbing disconnect, he says, between the experiences of the men and women in uniform and the perspective of people here at home. ''We have a very diverse membership in I.A.V.A.,'' he said. ''We've got Republicans and Democrats and everything in between. But one of the key things we all have in common is this frustration with the detachment that we see all around us, this idea that we're at war and everybody else is watching 'American Idol.'''I think that's one of the main reasons why so many guys want to go back to Iraq. They come home and feel like: 'Man, I don't fit in here. You know, I'm out of place.' '' Even though there's never been a clear statement of the military's mission in Iraq, and the goals have shifted from month to month and year to year, the soldiers and marines who have been sent there have felt that they were carrying out an important task on behalf of the nation.''It's tough to have such a serious sense of commitment,'' Mr. Rieckhoff said, ''and then come home and see so many people focused on such frivolous things. So I think that frustration is serious and growing. And I'll tell you the truth: I blame the president for that. One of the biggest criticisms of the president, and I hear this across the board, is that he hasn't asked the American people to do anything.''Mr. Rieckhoff is convinced that if the public heard more from the soldiers and marines who have actually experienced combat, including those who have been wounded and suffered emotional trauma, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would be viewed more seriously. Part of the problem, he said, is that too many civilians have little or no understanding of what war is really like, and of the toll it takes beyond the obvious toll of the dead and wounded.Among other things, there are family problems, drug and alcohol abuse, untreated post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicide -- all directly attributable to service in a war zone. ''Incredibly,'' he writes in his book, ''no government agency keeps track of the number of veterans who kill themselves after their service has ended -- another sign of how little value is placed on veterans' long-term well-being.''I mentioned a young soldier I had interviewed in 2005 who worried that because he had killed three insurgents during a battle in Iraq he might not be ''allowed into heaven.'' The soldier wondered whether he had ''done the right thing.''Mr. Rieckhoff nodded. ''Asking somebody to die for their country might not be the biggest thing you can ask,'' he said. ''Asking my guys to kill, on my orders -- as an officer, that's difficult. I'm telling that kid to squeeze that round off and take a man's life. And then he's got that baggage for the rest of his life. That's what you have to live with.''I signaled for the check and we left the restaurant. It was a beautiful, sunlit afternoon. New Yorkers were smiling and enjoying the spring weather. There was no sign of a war anywhere.Op-Ed ColumnistIt was a nice moment. The sky was filled with thick, dark clouds and a monsoonlike storm was on its way, but there was the presidential candidate, John Edwards, in work boots, jeans and a navy blue shirt, talking with a handful of neighborhood people gathered outside a house that was being built in the Ninth Ward.The former senator was there for a photo-op and the chat wouldn't last long. But the people, most of them young, were excited to see him. They listened thoughtfully and asked a number of questions.The scene was immensely more appealing than the overly scripted televised ''debates'' that feature sleep-inducing nonanswers from an army of candidates browbeaten by moderators wielding stopwatches.New Orleans has not been a hot topic at those upscale gatherings. Much of the city is still in ruins, still in ''terrible shape,'' as Mr. Edwards noted. During a lengthy interview that followed his talk with the local residents, he told me that what had been allowed to happen to New Orleans was ''an embarrassment for America'' and that as president he would put the power of the federal government squarely behind its revival.He said he would appoint a high-level official to take charge of the rebuilding, and he would have that person ''report to me'' every day. He said he would create 50,000 ''steppingstone jobs,'' in parks, recreation facilities and a variety of community projects, for New Orleans residents who have been unable to find any other work. And he said, ''We're also going to have to rebuild these levees.''(As if to underscore the last point, torrential rains on the same day as the interview caused dangerous flooding in the city. The levees were not an issue in this case. But the flooding occurred just as attention was being focused on serious flaws that have been found in repairs made to the levees after Hurricane Katrina.)Mr. Edwards, who announced his campaign for the presidency in the Ninth Ward, has stood by his commitment to make poverty one of his big campaign issues. I mentioned that poverty has not gotten much attention from the national media, and asked why middle-class Americans should care about the issue.''First, you should care because it's a moral issue,'' he said. ''It tells us something about the character of our country. And, by the way, I think most people do care about it. And second, you should care because if you want to see the American economy grow and strengthen over time, the strength and breadth of the middle class is a critical factor. When we have middle-class families struggling on the edge, falling into poverty or near poverty, those things weaken the American economy.''It's not a good sign, said Mr. Edwards, to have so much of the middle class hanging on by its fingertips at the same time that the ranks of the poor are growing. There are about 37 million Americans living below the poverty line, five million more than when President Bush took office.In an essay in the recently published book ''Ending Poverty in America,'' which he co-edited, Mr. Edwards wrote: ''The real story is not the number but the people behind the number. The men, women and children living in poverty -- one in eight of us -- do not have enough money for the food, shelter, and clothing they need. One in eight. That is not a problem. That is not a challenge. That is a plague.''Mr. Edwards, the founder and former director of the Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said poverty has proved to be so intractable because there are so many contributing factors. It's an extremely complex problem, and there is no one solution, no silver bullet.As president, he said, he would push hard for a ''significant'' increase in the minimum wage, would expand the earned income tax credit, would insist on making it easier for workers to organize, and would focus a substantial portion of his administration's energy on achieving concrete improvements in education, housing and health care.It's true that promises from politicians come at us like weeds on steroids. But the nation would get a clearer picture of the character, integrity and leadership qualities of individual candidates if the press would focus more intently on matters of substance.As a rule, we're much more interested in gaffes than in the details of a candidate's position on a complex issue. We're much more interested in sound bites than in sound policy.That should change. We should give the candidates time to speak. And we should listen.Op-Ed ColumnistThe United States may be the richest country in the world, but there are many millions -- tens of millions -- who are not sharing in that prosperity.According to the most recent government figures, 37 million Americans are living below the official poverty threshold, which is $19,971 a year for a family of four. That's one out of every eight Americans, and many of them are children.More than 90 million Americans, close to a third of the entire population, are struggling to make ends meet on incomes that are less that twice the official poverty line. In my book, they're poor.We don't see poor people on television or in the advertising that surrounds us like a second atmosphere. We don't pay much attention to the millions of men and women who are changing bedpans, or flipping burgers for the minimum wage, or vacuuming the halls of office buildings at all hours of the night. But they're there, working hard and getting very little in return.The number of poor people in America has increased by five million over the past six years, and the gap between rich and poor has grown to historic proportions. The richest one percent of Americans got nearly 20 percent of the nation's income in 2005, while the poorest 20 percent could collectively garner only a measly 3.4 percent.A new report from a highly respected task force on poverty put together by the Center for American Progress tells us, ''It does not have to be this way.'' The task force has made several policy recommendations, and said that if all were adopted poverty in the U.S. could be cut in half over the next decade.The tremendous number of people in poverty is an enormous drag on the U.S. economy. And one of the biggest problems is the simple fact that so many jobs pay so little that even fulltime, year-round employment is not enough to raise a family out of poverty. One-fifth of the working men in America and 29 percent of working women are in such jobs.Peter Edelman, a Georgetown law professor who was a co-chairman of the task force, said, ''An astonishing number of people are working as hard as they possibly can but are still in poverty or have incomes that are not much above the poverty line.''So the starting point for lifting people out of poverty should be to see that men and women who are working are adequately compensated for their labor. The task force recommended that the federal minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, be raised to half the average hourly wage in the U.S., which would bring it to $8.40.The earned-income tax credit, which has proved very successful in supplementing the earnings of low-wage working families, should be expanded to cover more workers, the task force said. It also recommended expanded coverage of the federal child care tax credit, which is currently $1,000 per child for up to three children.A crucial component to raising workers out of poverty would be an all-out effort to ensure that workers are allowed to form unions and bargain collectively. As the task force noted, ''Among workers in similar jobs, unionized workers have higher pay, higher rates of health coverage, and better benefits than do nonunionized workers.''In a recent interview about poverty, former Senator John Edwards told me: ''Organizing is so important. We have 50 million service economy jobs and we'll probably have 10 or 15 million more over the next decade. If those jobs are union jobs, they'll be middle-class families. If not, they're more likely to live in poverty. It's that strong.''The task force made several other recommendations, including proposals to ease access to higher education for poor youngsters, to help former prisoners find employment, to develop a more equitable unemployment compensation system, and to establish housing policies that would make it easier for poor people to move from neighborhoods of concentrated poverty to areas with better employment opportunities and higher-quality public services.Mr. Edelman, an adviser on social policy in the Clinton administration, stressed that there is no one answer to the problem of poverty, and that in addition to public policy initiatives, it's important to address the ''things people have to do within their own communities to take responsibility for themselves and for each other.''But he added, ''It is unacceptable for this country, which is so wealthy, to have this many people who are left out.''Op-Ed ColumnistIt sounds reasonable: seven paid sick days a year. Why should you have to lose a couple of days pay, or maybe even your job, because you had the misfortune to catch the flu?And it certainly seems unreasonable to penalize an employee in good standing who misses a day or two of work to care for a child who is ill or has met with a serious accident.After all, this is the 21st century.The reality, for a surprising percentage of the U.S. population, is more like the 19th century. Nearly half of all full-time private sector workers in the U.S. get no paid sick days. None. If one of those workers woke up with excruciating pains in his or her chest and had to be rushed to a hospital -- well, no pay for that day. For many of these workers, the cost of an illness could be the loss of their job.The situation is ridiculous for those in the lowest quarter of U.S. wage earners. Nearly 80 percent of those workers -- the very ones who can least afford to lose a day's pay -- get no paid sick days at all.I recently spoke with Bertha Brown, a home health aide who lives in Philadelphia and has two young daughters. She makes $7 an hour caring for people who are ill or disabled. ''I feed them and dress them,'' she said. ''And if they have to be changed, I do all that.''She has worked for the better part of two decades without ever being paid for a sick day. And her wages are so low she can't afford to lose even a day's pay. ''If I get sick, I work sick,'' she said. ''I cover my nose and my mouth with a mask to keep my clients from getting sick.''Food service workers are among those least likely to get paid sick days. Eighty-six percent get no sick days at all. They show up in the restaurants coughing and sneezing and feverish, and they start preparing and serving meals. You won't see many of them wearing masks.There's an effort under way to change this picture. A growing number of organizations and activists are lining up behind proposed federal legislation that would give most workers the right to seven paid sick days annually to take care of their medical needs or those of their families. The legislation, sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative Rosa DeLauro, would require employers with 15 or more workers to provide the sick days.Among the organizations pushing for paid sick days is the Public Welfare Foundation in Washington, which recently approved a $1 million ''special initiative'' on the issue. Deborah Leff, the foundation's president, noted that it's the poorest workers who most often are forced to choose between going to work sick or losing a day's pay, and that a disproportionate number of those workers are women -- many of them with children.''At least 145 countries have paid sick days,'' said Ms. Leff. ''The United States is the only industrialized country lacking such a policy. Our goal is to change that.''An overwhelming majority of Americans favor paid sick days for full-time workers. One poll showed that 95 percent of workers find it ''unacceptable'' for employers to deny sick days to workers. But the Kennedy-DeLauro legislation is facing a tough road.As one might imagine, the industries that would be affected are ice-cold to the idea.The response of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store to my inquiries on this issue is illustrative. A spokeswoman said in an e-mail message: ''Because employees working in the restaurants have flexible schedules, they can schedule doctors' appointments and other appointments that sick leave and personal time are generally used for at times when they are not working.''If employees need to miss a shift due to illness, there are generally many opportunities to make up that lost shift later in the week, or the next week.''That is the kind of workplace policy that prompts Debra Ness, the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, to note that ''for millions of workers, getting sick can mean the beginning of an economic disaster.''Allowing a worker to recuperate from an illness, or take care of a sick child, without suffering undue economic hardship should be a matter of basic humanity and fundamental decency. It should not be politically controversial in a country that considers itself the most advanced on the face of the earth, and that babbles incessantly about the importance of family values.Op-Ed ColumnistFourteen-year-old Devante Johnson deserved better. He was a sweet kid, an honor student and athlete who should be enjoying music and sports and skylarking with his friends at school. Instead he's buried in Houston's Paradise North Cemetery.Devante died of kidney cancer in March. His mother, Tamika Scott, believes he would still be alive if bureaucrats in Texas hadn't fouled up so badly that his health coverage was allowed to lapse and his cancer treatment had to be interrupted.Ms. Scott, who has multiple sclerosis, understood the grave danger her son would be in if he were somehow to be left without the Medicaid coverage that paid for his chemotherapy, radiation and other treatment. She submitted the required paperwork to renew the coverage two months before the deadline.''I was so anxious to get it processed,'' she said, ''so we wouldn't have a lapse of coverage.''In Texas, as in many other states, there is a concerted effort to undermine programs that bring government-sponsored health care to poor and working-class children. It is not an environment in which bureaucrats are encouraged to be helpful, not even when lives are at stake.''They kept losing the paperwork,'' Ms. Scott told me, her voice quivering with grief. She submitted new applications, made dozens of phone calls and sent off a blizzard of faxes. Despite her frantic efforts, the coverage was dropped.When the coverage lapsed, the treatment Devante had been receiving ceased. ''They put us on clinical trials,'' Ms. Scott said. ''They changed his medicine, and he started getting sicker and sicker. After awhile it was like his body was so frail and he was so weak he could barely walk on his own.''Four months after the Medicaid coverage lapsed, the mistakes were finally corrected and the coverage was reinstated. By then, there was no chance to save Devante.''I believe he would be with me now if they hadn't let his insurance lapse,'' said Ms. Scott.Across America children by the millions are being denied the health care they need and deserve -- and some are dying -- because the U.S. has no coherent system of health coverage for children.Stories like Devante Johnson's are not unusual. Three months ago a homeless seventh grader in Prince George's County, Maryland, died because his mother could not find a dentist who would do an $80 tooth extraction. Deamonte Driver, 12, eventually was given medicine at a hospital emergency room for headaches, sinusitis and a dental abscess.The child was sent home, but his distress only grew. It turned out that bacteria from the abscessed tooth had spread to his brain. A pair of operations and eight subsequent weeks of treatment, which cost more than a quarter of a million dollars, could not save him. He died on Feb. 25.There's a presidential election under way and one of the key issues should be how to provide comprehensive health coverage for all of the nation's children, which would be the logical next step on the road to coverage for everyone.That an American child could die because his mother couldn't afford to have a diseased tooth extracted sounds like a horror story from some rural outpost in the Great Depression. It's the kind of gruesomely tragic absurdity you'd expect from Faulkner. But these things are happening now.''People don't understand the amount of time and stress parents are going through as they try to get their children the coverage they need, in many cases just to stay alive,'' said Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund and a tireless advocate of expanding health coverage to the millions of American children who are uninsured or underinsured.Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program provide crucially important coverage, but the eligibility requirements can be daunting, budget constraints in many jurisdictions have led to tragic reductions in coverage, and millions of youngsters simply fall through the cracks in the system, receiving no coverage at all.It is time for all that to end. American children should be guaranteed nothing less than comprehensive health coverage from birth through age 18. This can be achieved if an effort is mounted that is comparable to that which led to the first moon shot, or the Marshall Plan, or the postwar G.I. bill.Keeping American children alive and healthy should be at least as important as any of those worthy projects.Op-Ed ColumnistA public high school teacher in Brooklyn told me recently about a student who didn't believe that a restaurant tab for four people could come to more than $500. The student shook his head, as if resisting the very idea. He just couldn't fathom it.''How much can you eat?'' the student asked.When I asked a teacher in a second school to mention the same issue, one of the responses was, ''Is this a true story?''A lot of New Yorkers are doing awfully well. There are 8 million residents of New York City, and roughly 700,000 are worth a million dollars or more. The average price of a Manhattan apartment is $1.3 million. The annual earnings of the average hedge fund manager is $363 million.The estimated worth of the mayor, Michael Bloomberg, ranges from $5.5 billion to upwards of $20 billion.You want a gilded age? This is it. The elite of the Roaring Twenties would be stunned by the wealth of the current era.Now the flip side, which is the side those public school students are on. One of the city's five counties, the Bronx, is the poorest urban county in the nation. The number of families in the city's homeless shelters is the highest it has been in a quarter of a century. Twenty-five percent of all families with children in New York City -- that's 1.5 million New Yorkers -- are trying to make it on incomes that are below the poverty threshold established by the federal government.The streets that are paved with gold for some are covered with ash for many others. There are few better illustrations of the increasingly disturbing divide between rich and poor than New York City.''I get to walk in both worlds,'' said Larry Mandell, the president of the United Way of New York City. ''In a given day I might be in a soup kitchen and also in the halls of Fortune 500 companies dealing with the senior executives. I've become acutely aware that the lives of those who are well off are not touched at all by contact with the poor. It's not that people don't care or don't want to help. It's that they have very little awareness of poverty.''I'd always thought of the United Way as a charitable outfit. But Mr. Mandell has committed his organization to the important task of raising the awareness of Americans and their political leaders to the pressing needs of America's cities, and especially the long-neglected, poverty-stricken neighborhoods of the inner cities.It's a measure of how low the bar has been set for success in America's cities that New York is thought to be doing well, even though 185,000 of its children ages 5 or younger are poor, and 18,000 are consigned to homeless shelters each night. More than a million New Yorkers get food stamps, and another 700,000 are eligible but not receiving them. That's a long, long way from a $500 restaurant tab.Only 50 percent of the city's high school students graduate in four years. And if you talk to the kids in the poorer neighborhoods, they will tell you that they don't feel safe. They are worried about violence and gang activity, which in their view is getting worse, not better.This is what's going on in the nation's most successful big city.Mr. Mandell is upset that urban issues, which in so many cases are related to poverty, have played such a minuscule role in the presidential campaign so far. ''People need to become more aware of the issue of poverty,'' he said. ''It's discouraging, frankly, to have it barely mentioned at all in the debates.''It's true that John Edwards is the one candidate who seems concerned about it, but to actually have the issue come up just briefly in the debates, and not at all in the Republican debate -- well, my view is that we have to change that.''The United Way of New York has issued a white paper on ''America's Urban Agenda'' that says, ''The greatest single challenge most American cities face lies in the increasing divide between the haves and have-nots.''There was a time, some decades ago, when urban issues and poverty were important components of presidential campaigns. Now the poor are kept out of sight, which makes it easier to leave them farther and farther behind. We've apparently reached a point in our politics when they aren't even worth mentioning.Op-Ed ColumnistNo one is paying much attention, but parts of New York City are like a police state for young men, women and children who happen to be black or Hispanic. They are routinely stopped, searched, harassed, intimidated, humiliated and, in many cases, arrested for no good reason.Most black elected officials have joined their white colleagues and the media in turning a blind eye to this continuing outrage. And many black cops have joined their white colleagues in the systematic mistreatment.Last Monday in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, about three dozen grieving young people on their way to a wake for a teenage friend who had been murdered were surrounded by the police, cursed at, handcuffed and ordered into paddy wagons. They were taken to the 83rd precinct stationhouse, where several were thrown into jail.Leana Matia, an 18-year-old student at John Jay College, was one of those taken into custody. ''We were walking toward the train station to take the L train when all these cops just swooped in on us,'' she said. ''They cursed us out and pushed the guys. And then they handcuffed us. We kept asking, 'What are you doing?' ''Children as young as 13 were among those swept up by the cops. Two of them, including 16-year-old Lamel Carter, were the children of police officers. Some of the youngsters were carrying notes from school saying that they were allowed to be absent to attend the wake. There is no evidence that I've been able to find -- other than uncorroborated statements by the police -- that the teenagers were misbehaving in any way.Everyone was searched, but nothing unlawful was found -- no weapons, no marijuana or other drugs. Some of the kids were told at the scene that they were being seized because they had assembled unlawfully. ''I didn't know what unlawful assembly was,'' said Kumar Singh, 18, who was among those arrested.According to the police, the youngsters at the scene were on a rampage, yelling and blocking traffic. That does not seem to be the truth.I spoke individually to several of the youngsters, to the principal of Bushwick Community High School (where a number of the kids are students), to a parent who was at the scene, and others. Nowhere was there even a hint of the chaos described by the police. Every account that I was able to find described a large group of youngsters, very sad and downcast about the loss of their friend, walking peacefully toward the station.Kathleen Williams, whose son and two nieces were rounded up, was at the scene. She said there was no disturbance at all, and that when she tried to ask the police why the kids were being picked up, she was told to be quiet or she would be arrested, too.Capt. Scott Henderson of the 83rd Precinct told me that the police had developed a ''plan'' to deal with youngsters going to the wake because they suspected that the murder was gang-related and there had already been some retaliation. He said he had personally witnessed the youngsters in Bushwick behaving badly and gave the order to arrest them.Many of the kids were wearing white T-shirts with a picture of the dead teenager and the letters ''R.I.P.'' on them. The cops cited the T-shirts as evidence of gang membership.Thirty-two of the youngsters were arrested. Most were charged with unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. Several were held in jail overnight.Police Commissioner Ray Kelly did not exactly give the arrests a ringing endorsement. He said, in a prepared statement, ''A police captain who witnessed the activity made a good-faith judgment in ordering the arrests.''A spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, said, ''It wouldn't be unusual for a lot of this stuff to get dismissed.''The principal of Bushwick Community High, Tira Randall, said, ''My kids come in here on a daily basis with stories about harassment by the police. They're not making these stories up.''New York City cops stopped and, in many cases, searched individuals more than a half million times last year. Those stops are not happening on Park Avenue or Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Thousands upon thousands of them amount to simple harassment of young black and Hispanic males and females who have done absolutely nothing wrong, but feel helpless to object.It is long past time for this harassment of ethnic minorities by the police to cease. Why it has been tolerated this long, I have no idea.Op-Ed ColumnistThese are small incidents, but they are accumulating by the tens of thousands, and someday New Yorkers are going to be shocked by the power of the anger that these seemingly insignificant incidents have generated.The principal of Bushwick Community High School in Brooklyn told me about a student who was gratuitously insulted by a police officer at a subway station the other day. The girl had lost her MetroCard and was carrying a note on the school's letterhead asking that she be allowed to ride the train. This was fine with the token clerk, but the clerk told the girl to show the note to a cop on duty at the station.The cop, in front of several onlookers, told the girl she was the oldest-looking high school student he had ever seen. He demanded that she tell him the square root of 12. He loudly declared that she was stupid and refused to let her board a train.The girl left the station devastated and in tears. No big deal. Certainly not newsworthy. Just another case of cops being cops.Several students from Bushwick Community High were among the three dozen or so who were swept up by the cops last week as they were walking toward a subway station on their way to a wake for a teenage friend who had been murdered. For black and Hispanic youngsters, grieving can be a criminal offense.One of those arrested was 16-year-old Lamel Carter, the son of a police detective. I interviewed him after he had spent a night in jail.''It was pretty nasty,'' he said. ''There were five of us in each cell. One of my friends was throwing up, and another had an asthma attack. The police said they got us for unlawful assembly.''[I asked the police captain who ordered the arrests, Scott Henderson, to explain the offense of unlawful assembly. He couldn't. ''If you would like the exact definition,'' he said, ''I would have to look that up.'']Fifteen minutes after I interviewed Lamel, he was stopped again by two police officers. They asked him where he was going, ordered him to spread-eagle himself against a patrol car, searched him and then him let go.He was just another black kid (now with a brand-new arrest record) on the streets of Brooklyn. No big deal. Just one of hundreds of similar stops each day.One of the youngsters arrested while trying to attend the wake was Aliek Robinson, a 17-year-old who had come up from Baltimore. He had known the slain youth, Donnell McFarland, whose nickname was Freshh, since he was 6 years old. When I interviewed him, Aliek told me how one of the cops had gone out of his way to mock his dead friend.''After we got arrested, the cops were questioning us one by one,'' he said. ''This one cop had a smile on his face and he said, 'Your man, Freshh, he was babbling like a little girl when he died.' And then he started giggling. I don't know why he said that. He didn't have to say that.''Just cops being cops.The important thing to remember here is that this behavior, in neighborhoods where the majority of the residents are black and Hispanic, is often the norm. This is not unusual police behavior. There is a huge percentage of cops on patrol whose knee-jerk approach to policing is to treat all young blacks and Hispanics as potential criminals.All high-ranking public officials in the city are aware of what is going on. I asked a black official, who asked not to be identified, why more minority officeholders aren't objecting publicly to the way minority youth are treated by the police. He said no one wants to be responsible for challenging the cops and then being blamed if crime statistics start to go back up.The two individuals most responsible for this sorry state of affairs are Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All it would take is a directive from them to bring the ugly harassment under control.A big gang problem has quietly developed in New York, and there are fears in the neighborhoods of a troubled summer. The response to this very serious situation should not be to treat all kids like criminals, which is both wrong and self-defeating.The police need the confidence and cooperation of law-abiding young people. Systematically demeaning them is hardly the way to achieve that.Op-Ed ColumnistYou most likely have no idea of the abusive treatment that students and teachers at many of New York City's public schools are enduring at the hands of overly aggressive police officers and security aides assigned to the schools.Students are being belittled, shouted at, cursed at, intrusively searched and improperly touched by cops and security aides who answer to the Police Department, not school authorities. In many cases, the students are roughed up, handcuffed, arrested and taken off to jail for behavior that does not even begin to approach the criminal. Teachers and administrators who have attempted to intervene on the behalf of students have themselves been abused, and in some cases arrested.This poisonous police behavior is an extension into the schools of the humiliating treatment cops have long been doling out to youngsters -- especially those who are black or Latino -- on the city's streets.In January, a 15-year-old girl at Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn was manhandled for no discernible reason by an armed police sergeant. The sergeant had grabbed her book bag and ordered her into a school detention room. When the girl replied, ''That's where I'm going,'' the sergeant is alleged to have pushed her. The girl then said she was going to take down his name and badge number.When she said that, according to a new study of police practices in the public schools by the American Civil Liberties Union, the sergeant jerked the girl's left arm behind her back at a painful angle. The girl's right hand slammed against a wall and she began to cry.Students inside the room cried out in protest, but to no avail. The girl was taken to the police station and given a summons. That night the school's assistant principal called the girl's home and apologized to her mother for the incident.One morning last fall a large contingent of police officers arrived unannounced at Wadleigh, a high school for the performing arts in Harlem, to do a spot check for weapons by herding students through portable metal detectors. One of the students, the vice president of the school government association, was afraid his cellphone would be confiscated so he called his mother and asked her to come get it. He waited outside the school for her to arrive.When police officers approached him, he explained that his mother was coming to meet him and would be there in just a few minutes. The police, according to the report, called him a smart-aleck, seized his cellphone, handcuffed him, took him to the local stationhouse and put him in jail.Unaware that her son had been arrested, the mother was frantic when she couldn't find him at the school. The charges against the boy were later dropped.There is nothing unusual about this type of activity. A math teacher at the Urban Assembly Academy of History and Citizenship rushed outside the school one day last fall when he heard that a student was being assaulted. He saw a police officer slam a boy against a car. Explaining that the boy was his student, the teacher said, ''He's just a kid.''According to the report, the police officer then hit and shoved the teacher. People in a group that had gathered cried out: ''He's a teacher! He's a teacher!''A second officer reportedly grabbed the teacher from behind and threw him onto the sidewalk. The teacher's head bounced against the pavement. While on the ground, the teacher was handcuffed as students and school staffers looked on. He was arrested and taken off to jail.The report, a must-read for anyone interested in the reality of public school life in New York, is titled ''Criminalizing the Classroom'' and was released jointly by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Racial Justice Program of the national A.C.L.U.''Girls,'' the report said, ''are particularly targeted for intrusive searches. Girls whose underwire bras set off metal detectors must lift up their shirts so (security aides) can verify that they are not concealing metal objects. Many girls reported that officers ordered them to unbuckle and/or unzip their pants for the purpose of verifying that the students were not concealing cellphones.''There is no excuse whatever for this systematic mistreatment of New York City students. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is in charge of the school system, and he and Commissioner Ray Kelly run the Police Department. Parents across the city should demand that they step in and bring this cruel madness to an end.Op-Ed ColumnistAl Gore is earnestly talking about the long-term implications of the energy and climate crises, and how the Arctic ice cap is receding much faster than computer models had predicted, and how difficult and delicate a task it will be to try and set things straight in Iraq.You look at him and you can't help thinking how bizarre it is that this particular political figure, perhaps the most qualified person in the country to be president, is sitting in a wing chair in a hotel room in Manhattan rather than in the White House.He's pushing his book ''The Assault on Reason.'' I find myself speculating on what might have been if the man who got the most votes in 2000 had actually become president. It's like imagining an alternate universe.The war in Iraq would never have occurred. Support and respect for the U.S. around the globe would not have plummeted to levels that are both embarrassing and dangerous. The surpluses of the Clinton years would not have been squandered like casino chips in the hands of a compulsive gambler on a monumental losing streak.Mr. Gore takes a blowtorch to the Bush administration in his book. He argues that the free and open democratic processes that have made the United States such a special place have been undermined by the administration's cynicism and excessive secrecy, and by its shameless and relentless exploitation of the public's fear of terror.The Bush crowd, he said, has jettisoned logic, reason and reflective thought in favor of wishful thinking in the service of an extreme political ideology. It has turned its back on reality, with tragic results.So where does that leave Mr. Gore? If the republic is in such deep trouble and the former vice president knows what to do about it, why doesn't he have an obligation to run for president? I asked him if he didn't owe that to his fellow citizens.If the country needs you, how can you not answer the call?He seemed taken aback. ''Well, I respect the logic behind that question,'' he said. ''I also am under no illusion that there is any position that even approaches that of president in terms of an inherent ability to affect the course of events.''But while leaving the door to a possible run carefully ajar, he candidly mentioned a couple of personal reasons why he is disinclined to seek the presidency again.''You know,'' he said, ''I don't really think I'm that good at politics, to tell you the truth.'' He smiled. ''Some people find out important things about themselves early in life. Others take a long time.''He burst into a loud laugh as he added, ''I think I'm breaking through my denial.''I noted that he had at least been good enough to attract more votes than George W. Bush.''Well, there was that,'' he said, laughing again. ''But what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that I find I have in short supply.''Mr. Gore is passionate about the issues he is focused on -- global warming, the decline of rational discourse in American public life, the damage done to the nation over the past several years. And he has contempt for the notion that such important and complex matters can be seriously addressed in sound-bite sentences or 30-second television ads, which is how presidential campaigns are conducted.He pressed this point when he talked about Iraq.''One of the hallmarks of a strategic catastrophe,'' he said, ''is that it creates a cul-de-sac from which there are no good avenues of easy departure. Taking charge of the war policy and extricating our troops as quickly as possible without making a horrible situation even worse is a little like grabbing a steering wheel in the middle of a skid.''There is no quick and easy formula, he said. A new leader implementing a new policy on Iraq would have to get a feel for the overall situation. The objective, however, should be clear: ''To get our troops out of there as soon as possible while simultaneously observing the moral duty that all of us share -- including those of us who opposed this war in the first instance -- to remove our troops in a way that doesn't do further avoidable damage to the people who live there.''I asked if he meant that all U.S. troops should ultimately be removed from Iraq.''Yes,'' he said.Then he was off to talk more about his book.Op-Ed ColumnistThe latest news-as-entertainment spectacular is the Paris Hilton criminal justice fiasco. She's in! She's out! She's -- whatever.Far more disturbing (and much less entertaining) is the way school officials and the criminal justice system are criminalizing children and teenagers all over the country, arresting them and throwing them in jail for behavior that in years past would never have led to the intervention of law enforcement.This is an aspect of the justice system that is seldom seen. But the consequences of ushering young people into the bowels of police precincts and jail cells without a good reason for doing so are profound.Two months ago I wrote about a 6-year-old girl in Florida who was handcuffed by the police and taken off to the county jail after she threw a tantrum in her kindergarten class.Police in Brooklyn recently arrested more than 30 young people, ages 13 to 22, as they walked toward a subway station, on their way to a wake for a teenage friend who had been murdered. No evidence has been presented that the grieving young people had misbehaved. No drugs or weapons were found. But they were accused by the police of gathering unlawfully and of disorderly conduct.In March, police in Baltimore handcuffed a 7-year-old boy and took him into custody for riding a dirt bike on the sidewalk. The boy tearfully told The Baltimore Examiner, ''They scared me.'' Mayor Sheila Dixon later apologized for the arrest.Children, including some who are emotionally disturbed, are often arrested for acting out. Some are arrested for carrying sharp instruments that they had planned to use in art classes, and for mouthing off.This is a problem that has gotten out of control. Behavior that was once considered a normal part of growing up is now resulting in arrest and incarceration.Kids who find themselves caught in this unnecessary tour of the criminal justice system very quickly develop malignant attitudes toward law enforcement. Many drop out -- or are forced out -- of school. In the worst cases, the experience serves as an introductory course in behavior that is, in fact, criminal.There is a big difference between a child or teenager who brings a gun to school or commits some other serious offense and someone who swears at another student or gets into a wrestling match or a fistfight in the playground. Increasingly, especially as zero-tolerance policies proliferate, children are being treated like criminals for the most minor offenses.There should be no obligation to call the police if a couple of kids get into a fight and teachers are able to bring it under control. But now, in many cases, youngsters caught fighting are arrested and charged with assault.A 2006 report on disciplinary practices in Florida schools showed that a middle school student in Palm Beach County who was caught throwing rocks at a soda can was arrested and charged with a felony -- hurling a ''deadly missile.''We need to get a grip.The Racial Justice Program at the American Civil Liberties Union has been studying this issue. ''What we see routinely,'' said Dennis Parker, the program's director, ''is that behavior that in my time would have resulted in a trip to the principal's office is now resulting in a trip to the police station.''He added that the evidence seems to show that white kids are significantly less likely to be arrested for minor infractions than black or Latino kids. The 6-year-old arrested in Florida was black. The 7-year-old arrested in Baltimore was black.Shaquanda Cotton was black. She was the 14-year-old high school freshman in Paris, Tex., who was arrested for shoving a hall monitor. She was convicted in March 2006 of ''assault on a public servant'' and sentenced to a prison term of -- hold your breath -- up to seven years!Shaquanda's outraged family noted that the judge who sentenced her had, just three months earlier, sentenced a 14-year-old white girl who was convicted of arson for burning down her family's home. The white girl was given probation.Shaquanda was recently released after a public outcry over her case and the eruption of a scandal involving allegations of widespread sexual abuse of incarcerated juveniles in Texas.This issue deserves much more attention. Sending young people into the criminal justice system unnecessarily is a brutal form of abuse with consequences, for the child and for society as a whole, that can last a lifetime.Op-Ed ColumnistA few weeks ago, Teri Hatcher, one of the stars of the television series ''Desperate Housewives,'' was on David Letterman's show, talking very animatedly about a time when her daughter needed emergency dental care.''It was causing her some pain,'' Ms. Hatcher said. ''And then, of course, it was a Friday night. Overnight the whole thing blew up and it turned out to be an abscess.''Where to get a dentist on a Saturday?Luckily, Ms. Hatcher's best friend is married to a dentist who was more than happy to open up his office that Saturday. But he needed an assistant. Ms. Hatcher volunteered.She digressed: ''I hate the dentist . Just my whole life, you know. It's the worst. I would do anything to get out of going to the dentist. Really. Anything.''But Ms. Hatcher stood there like a trouper as the dentist examined her daughter's tooth. ''He sees it is an abscess, and he has to do surgery,'' she said. ''So you, I'm trying to -- I hate it. I'm squeamish. I'm going to throw up, and then I'm trying to pull it together''So he does the Novocaine and gives her a little of the gas. She is perfectly fine, because she's going, 'I love the dentist. I want to come here every day.' And then, of course, I'm thinking, 'Can I take a tank of that home? Because that is really what I need.' ''And so on. The story, of course, had a happy ending. Ms. Hatcher's daughter was fine. Mr. Letterman got to tell a raunchy dentist joke. The audience was amused, and Ms. Hatcher eventually exited to a robust round of applause.I was particularly interested in the segment because just a few hours earlier I had filed a column for the next day's paper about health care for children. The column included the story of Deamonte Driver, a homeless 12-year-old from Prince George's County, Md., who also had an abscessed tooth.Now, if I had been in Ms. Hatcher's position, I would have done exactly as she did. I would have knocked down doors if necessary to get help for a child in distress. So this is no criticism of her. It's an illustration of the kind of stunning differences in fortune that can face youngsters living at opposite ends of America's vast economic divide.Deamonte needed his tooth pulled, a procedure that was estimated to cost $80. But his mother, Alyce Driver, had no health insurance for her children. She believes their Medicaid coverage lapsed early this year because of a bureaucratic foul-up, perhaps because paperwork was mailed to a homeless shelter after they had left. In any event, it would have been difficult for Ms. Driver to find an oral surgeon willing to treat a Medicaid patient.Untreated, the pain in Deamonte's tooth grew worse. He was taken to a hospital emergency room, where he was given medication for pain and sinusitis and sent home.What started as a toothache now became a nightmare. Bacteria from the abscess had spread to Deamonte's brain. The child was in agony, and on Feb. 25 he died.There's a presidential election under way, but this sort of thing is not a big part of the campaign. American children are dying because of a lack of access to health care, and we're worried about Mitt Romney's religion and asking candidates to raise their hands to show whether they believe in evolution. I'm starting to believe in time travel because there's no doubt this nation is moving backward.''There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul,'' Nelson Mandela once said, ''than the way in which it treats its children.''There are nine million children who lack health care in the U.S. and millions more who are eligible for coverage but fall through the cracks for one reason or another.What we need is a national commitment to provide basic health care to all children, not just the children of the well-to-do. This should be a no-brainer. You're a child in the United States? You've got health care. We're not going to let you die from a toothache. We're better than that. We're not going to let your family go bankrupt because you've got cancer or some other disease, or because you've been in a terrible accident.The cost? Don't fall for that bogyman.There's plenty of give in America's glittering $13 trillion economy. What's the sense of being the richest nation on the planet if you can't even afford to keep your children healthy and alive?Op-Ed ColumnistEmmanuel Wayne pressed his back against the shabby, one-story building, trying unsuccessfully to escape the downpour. The blue-and-white sign overhead said Bill's Liquors.I was standing there with him. The water pouring down the teenager's face created a funhouse mirror effect, making it look like he was laughing and crying at the same time. It was an absurd place to conduct an interview, but a lot of things about the inner-city are absurd.''I been looking for a job,'' he said, ''but you know  .'' He shrugged. ''I went to the McDonald's. I was up to the Cherry Hill Mall. Ain't too much out here.''It was a gloomy late afternoon. Throughout the rundown neighborhood, young people were gathered in clusters on porches, looking out at the rain. I talked to some and they told the same story as Emmanuel. No jobs. No money.''That's why people go on the hustle,'' said one young man. ''Got to get the money somewhere.''The summer job outlook for teenagers is beyond bleak. A modest 157,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls in May. But teen employment fell for the fifth consecutive month, an ominous trend as we head into the summer months when millions of additional teenagers join in the hunt for jobs.From January through May, according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, ''the national teen employment rate averaged only 33.1 percent, tying for the lowest employment rate in the past 60 years.''For youngsters like Emmanuel Wayne and others in this distressed city just a stone's throw from Philadelphia, the problem is much worse. Last summer, the employment rate for black teens from low-income families was an abysmal 18 percent.This is the flip side of the American dream. Kids who grow up poor and never work at a regular job tend not to think in terms of postgraduate degrees, marriages and honeymoons, careers and the cost of educating the next generation.A steady job could make all the difference. Along with the paycheck comes a sense of the possibilities. Kids develop a clearer understanding of the value of education and are more likely to stay in school. The heightened sense of self-worth that comes from gainful employment can be a bulwark against negative peer pressure. Contacts are made and a work history established.''The more you work today, the more you're going to work tomorrow,'' said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies. ''And the more you work while you're in school, the easier it is to transition to the labor market when you graduate.''It seems obvious that we should be putting as many young people to work as possible, but the opposite is happening. The youth labor market in the U.S. has all but collapsed. Teens were especially hard hit by the recession that followed the employment boom of the late 1990s, and there has been no substantial recovery in the teen job market since then.Years ago the federal government played a major role in bolstering job opportunities for teenagers. There was substantial bipartisan support for both year-round and summer employment programs. But that important commitment vanished with the conservative onslaught of recent years.The result was inevitable. As the center has reported, ''Far fewer youth across the nation are gaining exposure to the job market and to the real world of work than in the late 1980s and 1990s.''What you are left with are frustrated youngsters, full of energy but lacking appropriate outlets, who have trouble figuring out what to do with themselves. It's an environment that is all but guaranteed to spawn bad choices.I asked Emmanuel what he might do if he couldn't find a job for the summer.''Don't know,'' he said. ''I got a buddy doing this and that. He could help me out.''The rain had eased up and Emmanuel was off. A man named Darnell, who said he was 23, came out of the liquor store. He and I talked for awhile about the summer prospects for teens in the neighborhood.''Well, there ain't no jobs in Camden,'' he said. ''Not for teenagers. If you can't get a job, you have to hustle. People be pushing weed. Cutting hair. Lifting stuff. The girls do their thing. It ain't no picnic out here. It's depressing.''Op-Ed ColumnistYou won't see these stories on television, but Marian Wright Edelman and Dr. Irwin Redlener could talk to you all day and all night about children whose lives have been lost or ruined because they didn't have health insurance.This is not a situation one associates with a so-called advanced country. That you can have sick children wasting away in the United States, the wealthiest nation on the planet, because medical treatment that could relieve their suffering is withheld by men and women with dollar signs instead of compassion in their eyes is beyond unconscionable.Ms. Edelman is the president of the Children's Defense Fund, and Dr. Redlener is president of the Children's Health Fund.Both are appalled at the embarrassing fact that nine million American children have no health coverage at all. Among them are children with diabetes, chronic asthma, heart conditions, life-threatening allergies and so on. In many instances they are left untreated until it is too late.Leaving children uninsured is a form of Russian roulette, Dr. Redlener said.''All children should be covered,'' said Ms. Edelman.Congress and the president could do something about this right now. Of the nine million children without coverage, six million are already eligible for either Medicaid or the popular State Children's Health Insurance Program, or S-chip, which covers children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private health insurance. The bulk of the funding for S-chip comes from the federal government.S-chip, which had strong bipartisan support when it was established 10 years ago, is currently up for reauthorization in Congress. The program should be expanded as part of a broader effort to cover as many of the six million eligible-but-uninsured kids as possible.Eligible children remain outside of S-chip and Medicaid for a variety of reasons, including the following: because there is insufficient funding to cover them; because families do not realize their children qualify for coverage; because red tape and complicated regulations discourage families from signing up.A number of S-chip re-authorization proposals are being developed. The best-case scenario would be legislation -- costing as much as $50 billion in additional funding over the next five years -- that would cover millions of additional youngsters from poor and working-poor families. This would put the U.S. on the road toward universal coverage for children.Ten billion dollars a year is considered a pittance when it comes to funding wars and tax cuts for the very wealthy. But it's suddenly a lot of money when the subject is the health of American children.One of the worst scenarios has been offered by President Bush in his White House budget proposal. That calls for just $4.8 billion in new funding for S-chip over the next five years. The result, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would be a net loss of coverage for 1.4 million children.The old expression was ''taking candy from a baby.'' The White House is ready to take away vitally needed medicine.Negotiations over the reauthorization of S-chip are under way. It will be interesting to see whether the Democrats who crowed so much about their newfound power when they took control of Congress will stand tall for the kids of the poor and working poor, and whether there are enough caring Republicans to resurrect the spirit of bipartisanship from a decade ago.As the heat gets turned up on this issue, the White House appears to be falling into its old habit of creating its own reality.The Congressional Budget Office and most researchers have agreed on the six million figure for the number of youngsters who are eligible for government-sponsored health coverage but remain unenrolled -- roughly four million for Medicaid and two million for S-chip. This has not been controversial.Yesterday, the Department of Health and Human Services began circulating a study that tries to make the case that the total number of eligible but uninsured youngsters is a mere 794,000, an absurdly low figure.If you can wave a magic wand and make five million poor kids disappear, you no longer have to think about caring for them.Advocates like Dr. Redlener and Ms. Edelman don't have that luxury.''Kids who grow up with poor access to health care carry a high risk of having underdiagnosed and undertreated chronic illness, both physical and emotional,'' said Dr. Redlener. ''We know what to do. We should fully fund this effort at the $50 billion level and make coverage mandatory for all children.''OP-ED COLUMNIST
